2,"he tries to rememberisnt my normal always a bit low? he calls his sister and asks her. she says, yes, you usually came up 98.","for months, ive been laying out evidence that: a new coronavirus was never properly discovered; the diagnostic tests are therefore meaningless; and most of the people who are sick are suffering from traditional illnesses which have been re-packaged under the empty umbrella label, covid. of course, most people in the world have a religious belief in the new virus. and that opens the door to: psychological covid. here is what it can look like. a person is watching tv for hours. hes treated to wall-to-wall news, ads, public service announcementsall about the virus and the pandemic. after days and weeks and months of this solid operant conditioning, hes in the covid frame of mind. hes in the context, the box, the pattern, the story line. he occasionally feels a bit of this and that: a scratchy throat, a sniffle. so he thinks, maybe this is the start of covid. one day, he has a headache. he thinks, didnt they say that could be a symptom, too? he takes his temperature. 99.8. he tries to rememberisnt my normal always a bit low? he calls his sister and asks her. she says, yes, you usually came up 98. why? whats the matter? nothing. i had a little cough yesterday, so i took my temperature. it was 99.8. call the doctor. ill be fine. you dont know that. call the doctor. after talking to his sister, his throat feels raw. he makes some tea. he putters around the apartment. he feels tired. for a second, a pain shoots up his arm. they said the virus could cause a heart problem. he goes to the fridge, takes out half a cake and eats a large slice. now he really feels tired, so he lies down and goes to sleep. when he wakes up, his nose is stuffed. he walks into the bathroom and blows his nose. he looks at himself in the mirror. his eyes are a little red. his face is pale. he coughs three times. he calls his doctor. a nurse says, well, you might have a few symptoms. you should come in and get tested. the next day he does. for two days, while hes waiting for the results, hes sneezing on and off. his head is stuffed. hes sleeping more than usual. his limbs ache a bit. is he feeling a chill, or is that a breeze blowing in through the screen? if you told him his thoughts and his mindset could be bringing on physical symptoms, he wouldnt believe you. every year for the past ten years, hes had at least one episode of cough-sneeze-slight fever, and hes thought nothing of itbut if you reminded him of that now, he wouldnt pay attention. no, this is different. he begins to feel fear. in that state of mild fear, he imagines going to the hospital and being put on a ventilator. he imagines infecting someone else and being found out. he imagines dying. the fear ratchets up. he sits in front of the tv, hoping to distract himself. but the commercials show people wearing masks. the next day, the phone rings. its the nurse. she tells him hes positive for covid. hes infected. hell need to isolate himself for two weeks, and if the symptoms become worse, he should go to emergency now his fever inches over 100. hes coughing more. getting the picture? if you dont think the mind and thoughts can affect the body, think again. if you dont think the ability to resist and shake off a concocted story-line is important, think again. if you dont think the refusal to accept official pronouncements is vital this person im describing, who has now been tagged with the covid label, is suffering from nothing. as in: nothing. hes adding up and making up his own story line, which puts him in a hole. if someone slapping him in the face could wake him up, someone should slap him in the face. hes just been suckered in, and hes suckering himself in. sir, you have psychological covid. it goes under a better name. suckers disease. oh but waitwhat about the people who are really sick? as i mentioned at the top, most of those people are suffering from traditional illnesses that have nothing to do with a new virus. give me control of all major news outlets in the world, and venal mouthpieces like fauci to put on television day after day, and ill convince the population that pink panthers escaped from a zoo in the antarctic, and theyre roaming the globe spitting pink poison at billions of victims. and whatever the symptoms of pink poisoning are supposed to be, people will begin to experience them. sir, youre not feeling pink poison symptoms. they dont exist. i saw three panthers this afternoon on my lawn. they were your cats. you might recall that your wife, who is divorcing you, had them at her apartment. she dropped them off in your yard early this morning. before some people jump to erroneous conclusions, let me state this yet again: yes, there are people in the world who are actually sick and dying, as always, and most of those who have been labeled covid are suffering from traditional diseases, such as pneumonia, tb, flu, other lung problems, etc. the remaining people who are labeled covidyou would have to look at these groups, wherever they live, to discover causes, such as: new toxic vaccine campaigns; new levels or new content of deadly pollution; pesticides; treatments with ventilators and toxic antiviral drugs, etc. no new virus required. mind control or psychological covid is its own creature, and it is widespread. if anyone thinks my use of the term suckers disease is too strong, and is unkind, and i should have called it something like befuddlement syndrome, let me point out that, in this situation, being nice and polite doesnt cut through the mind control. in fact, nice and polite, as they have spread across society like a moldy blanket, are main components of the reason why people are buying the virus story and the consequent lockdowns and economic destruction. they dont want to make waves. they want to be kinder and gentler toward authority. they want to cozy up to fascism and cooperate in their own downfall. george carlin laid it out 20 years ago: what we have now is a completely neurotic population where did this sudden fear of germs come from in this country? have you noticed this? the media, constantly running stories about all the latest infections salmonella, e-coli, hanta virus, bird flu and americans, they panic easily so now everybodys running around, scrubbing this and spraying that and overcooking their food and repeatedly washing their hands, trying to avoid all contact with germs. its ridiculous and it goes to ridiculous lengths bunch of goddamn pussies! besides, what do you think you have an immune system for? its for killing germs!let me tell you a true story about immunization okay? when i was a little boy in new york city in the 1940s, we swam in the hudson river and it was filled with raw sewage okay? we swam in raw sewage! you know to cool off! and at that time, the big fear was polio; thousands of kids died from polio every year but you know something? in my neighborhood, no one ever got polio! no one! ever! you know why? cause we swam in raw sewage! it strengthened our immune systems! the polio never had a prayer; we were tempered in raw shit! so personally, i never take any special precautions against germs. i dont shy away from people that sneeze and cough, i dont wipe off the telephone, i dont cover the toilet seat, and if i drop food on the floor, i pick it up and eat it! yes i do. even if im at a sidewalk caf! in calcutta! the poor section! on new years morning during a soccer riot! and you know something? in spite of all that so-called risky behavior, i never get infections, i dont get them, i dont get colds, i dont get flu, i dont get headaches, i dont get upset stomach, you know why? cause i got a good strong immune system and it gets a lot of practice a person suffering from self-induced psychological covid needs to take a sledgehammer to his own complicity and the propaganda of the state. crack the egg and climb out and breathe.",1,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,45791,30,CovidVaccine

7,"in the case of johnson & johnson, the company promised to produce vaccines at cost for the duration of the emergency. when doggett and his staff asked what this means, they got no answer.","its surprising, or maybe it isnt, that all of this is going on during a period of intense political protest. for as much as america is going through changes, many of the dumbest aspects of our political system have remained impervious to reform. there was political will to change the formula for big pharma in the early nineties and in the obama years, and revolution is in the air now. just likely not enough to bring drug prices down to a reasonable level. profiteering over the coronavirus pandemic is still in the larval stage. the average news reader has heard some enraging stories a man busted for a $45 million scheme to defraud new york city through phony ppe sales, another arrested for hoarding 192,000 n95 respirator masks and 598,000 medical gloves, a third caught trying to bilk the va out of $750 million but the giant-scale gouging will take place later. and it will all be legal. soon enough, the infected and uninfected alike will pay any price to try to stave off illness through vaccines and cocktails of expensive treatments. it is an unprecedented profiteering opportunity, because most everyone on earth is destined to become a customer of some kind in fact, the united states is already a massive buyer of covid-19 treatments despite no evidence of efficacy. were in the extraordinary position of spending billions on vaccines before we know if they work, says doggett. some of the rush to spend money on treatments is driven by a perhaps-unrealistic expectation that vaccines will be available soon, or at all. dr. robert gallo, co-founder and international scientific adviser of the global virus network and one of the worlds leading virologists he is the co-discoverer of hiv and the developer of the hiv blood test, among other things worries that the unique characteristics of covid-19 will make it hard for any traditional vaccine to have durability. you look at the structure of the proteins, and its a lot like hiv, because of its glycan shields, he says, referring to sugars that protect viruses from antibodies. antibodies that are glycosylated in this way do not last. because of this, gallo says, he worries that companies might be tempted to declare victory prematurely. he warns that people who put timetables on when treatments might be available trump often says things like, were very close, and press observers like politico have warned that the administration is sitting on an october vaccine surprise are almost always being disingenuous. ive always said, you dont have a vaccine until you have one, until youre sure it works. still, theres widespread expectation that vaccines are coming weve heard reports about vaccines like astrazenecas azd1222 supposedly producing good results in trials and an observer looking on the surface level might conclude that big pharma in this crisis is breaking long-standing patterns of exploitation. after all, several of the biggest drugmakers have made public pledges to produce vaccines at cost, including johnson & johnson and astrazeneca. well do it at no profit, astrazeneca ceo pascal soriot said. this is what a successful, healthy pharmaceutical industry can do. the problem with these pledges is nobody knows what they mean. in the case of johnson & johnson, the company promised to produce vaccines at cost for the duration of the emergency. when doggett and his staff asked what this means, they got no answer. nor is there any transparency about what terms like cost mean, or how the billions allocated for research are being spent. add the unique arc of the covid-19 story which may require decades of intense, ongoing investment and gestures like the ones made by johnson & johnson and astrazeneca begin to give off an ominous odor. you can put about as much faith in their promises as you can in the pitch of any salesperson, says doggett. the covid-19 disaster will rely significantly upon these corporate drugmakers to not only come up with cures and treatments, but to also create a manageable price for people around the world, since the pandemic wont be stopped unless the whole world gets treated. is big pharma going to do the right thing? asks dana gill, u.s. policy adviser for doctors without borders. citing the historic example of the drugmakers reluctance to provide hiv drugs to poor nations, and even the high price of hepatitis treatments like sovaldi, she adds, theres plenty of examples of pharma companies not doing the right thing. what guarantees there will be a problem? the central role of the united states, whose dystopia of a medical bureaucracy is gods gift to pharmaceutical companies. every other country in the world has a three-stage process for approving and pricing prescription drugs. governments first ask if the drug is safe. if the answer is yes, it asks if the drug is effective. if the drug passes those two hurdles, most governments then ask how much more effective the new drug is compared to existing medicines. this efficacy calculation becomes the starting point for price negotiations, which usually involve threatening to keep the drug out of the countrys state-insured pool of medications if the company does not come up with a reasonable price. the u.s. either skips or botches these steps. first, there is no regulatory review that determines comparative efficacy. in the u.s., the fda review ends after the first two steps: once a drug is deemed safe and effective, it goes on the market. then comes the whopper: all fda-approved drugs must, by law, be covered by medicaid. this rule dates to 1990 with the creation of the medicaid drug rebate program. the grand bargain that was supposed to be built into this reform concept was that all fda drugs would be purchased by medicaid, provided that manufacturers gave the government either the best price available to insurers, or a 23.1 percent discount over the drugs list price. this sounds great, except drug manufacturers simply began figuring the medicaid discount into their list-price calculations. if the medical condition is serious enough and the drug has no effective analog, companies can dictate their price. as a result, we end up with situations like the 2014 sovaldi episode, in which medicaid spent $3 billion in a single year just on the one drug, and was still forced to severely ration the medicine, giving it to just 2.4 percent of hepatitis-c patients. gill notes that only 37 percent of americans are treated for hepatitis c even now, in part because of the high price of the drug. the business model for big pharma is brilliant. a substantial portion of research and development for new drugs is funded by the state, which then punts its intellectual work to private companies, who are then allowed to extract maximum profits back from the same government, which has over decades formalized an elaborate process of negotiating against itself in these matters. how big are these giveaways? since the 1930s, the nih has spent about $930 billion in research. between 2010 and 2016, every single drug that won approval from the fda 210 different pharmaceuticals grew at least in part out of research funded by the nih. a common pattern involves r&d conducted by a small or midsize company, which sells out to a behemoth like gilead the instant its drug makes it through trials, and obscene prices are set. this was the case with sovaldi, for instance, which gilead acquired when it spent $11 billion in 2012 buying out original developer pharmasset, which had worked on a line of hepatitis drugs. within five years, gilead earned more than $58 billion on a line of hepatitis treatments it won in the pharmasset deal. this same pattern seems likely to hold with covid-19 treatments, only the cycle of exploitation will be accelerated. its a microcosm of a larger broken system, in which you have an r&d system thats profit-driven rather than people-driven, says gill. these problems existed before covid-19, and now the u.s. is pumping billions of taxpayer funds into these companies, in most cases with no strings attached.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,48707,38,CovidVaccine

13,"and not a single democrat and maybe one republican said anything about it. - in 2018 i think it was, there were more gun related incidents then there are days in a year.","you're damn right i'm angry about those things. but they aren't opinions, they're facts about the us. and if they don't make you angry too then there's something wrong with you. - the ""free"" market is what made the 2008 financial crisis possible. - the us has been using it's position as a superpower to wreak havoc on countries it doesn't approve of or wants something from for decades. chile, venezuela, cuba, iran, syria. as well as letting it corporations abuse of other countries where there are less/no laws protecting workers. which is how you have corporations like nike that use child labour in third world countries. - the war in irak was started to steal their oil. - the us has been hitting venezuela with tarrifs and an embargo (like the us did with cuba for decades) which is wrecking their economy and blocking shipments of essential resources from the un essentialy ensuring that the people of venezuela suffer and die. and now the british central bank is refusing to let venezuela access it's own funds in the middle of god damn pandemic. because banks just love the us, they're the ones with the power in a world where the us has the most influence. - are you saying that pinochet _wasn't_ a guy that the us helped gain power in chile after helping to overthrow the democratically elected leader? and the us tried to do the same thing with maduro in venezuela. the cia's statement that there was coter fraud in the election where maduro won was bullshit. they say that he votes appeared out of the blue at the end and that it was voter fraud, but it was just that the votes were first coming in from the city where he's less popular and the increase in votes at the end was because he's more popular in the countryside. - neither the democrats nor the republicans care about satisfying the needs of the population past a few social reforms here and there. both are funded by corporations and banks and therefore do what they want. and it shows. the most recent example is the covid-19 bailout bill. not a single condition attached to essentially being allowed to take as much money as they want from the treasury. and not a single democrat and maybe one republican said anything about it. - in 2018 i think it was, there were more gun related incidents then there are days in a year. if that's not a result of lax guns laws i don't know what is.  - i hear more than i would like, and not just from americans: ""the market can regulate itself"", ""what does the government know about the market economy, we have to let the corporations take care of it."", "" regulation is authoritarian and an infringement on people's freedoms."" the market can't regulate itself, otherwise things like the 2008 financial crisis would never have happened or for a smaller example banks wouldn't harrass people who owe them money with robocalls and debt collectors. knowledge on the market and the economy isn't private information, it's available to everyone, and seeing some of the dumbasses there are in business, it definitely doesn't take a genius. as for regulation being an infringement on people's freedoms, the lack of regulation is depriving certain people of freedoms because of giving corporations maximum freedom. there comes a point where one person's freedom suppresses someone else's. we have far passed that point when it comes to corporations.  -communism is possible, communism is how the ussr was able to pull itself out of the crap they were in after they overthrew the tsar. and it isn't incompatible with the capitalist's vision of human nature, which is that people are in constant competition not cooperation. well scientists and historians have established that if homo sapiens hadn't cooperated to survive, we would most likely not be here. so that vision of human nature is obviously crap. - making intelligence look like a quality only antagonists posses. lex luthor and superman, darth sidius and luke, darth sidius and anakin, batman in any movie. the good guy just charges in without a plan and punches/shoots his way to victory with at most a half cooked plan that in part depends on chance. or just look at what disney did to artemis fowl, best example of dumbing down the protagonist i can think of and going for the pew pew yay we won and let's talk about our feelings which will help us win formula. - before obama signed the paris climate agreement the us didn't give a shit about climate change and in fact had and still has lobbyists fighting against substantial climate change reform. and trump pulled the us out of the paris climate agreement and called climate change a chinese hoax. - isis were only able to gain as much power and territory as they did because of the power vacuum left by the us when they pulled their forces out of the middle east, who were only there in the first place because the us wanted the oil in the region. and if you don't believe me, trump said in an address a few months ago ""we got the oil."". - if you're saying that people that are dying from lack of healthcare is just an opinion, then you're a fool who's just asking to get slapped.  - people in 2008 and today lost their jobs and were kicked out of their homes (hasn't happened yet concerning the economic crisis covid-19 caused but it will) all while the corporations were fed trillions to halt their freefall.  - anti-vaxxers are dangerous for society because all it would take is one idiot who doesn't like vaccines to catch a disease for it to survive. we almost eradicated tetanus some 15 years ago but there was a large enough group of idiots who didn't feel like getting vaccinated that it survived. and not to mention that it's incredibly selfish considering there are people who's wellbeing depends on other people getting vaccinated. as for flat-earthers. they're dangerous because they're propagating a distrust of science, just like the anti-vaxxers.  - ice are splitting families up. if you don't find that despicable then you're hopeless. - prisonners in the us are used as free/cheap labor. that makes us prisons labor camps. also not an, opinion, but a fact. - immigrants being detained in the us are being held in disgusting conditions. fact. - making marijuana illegal despite it not being a dangerous drug was just to make certain people look bad/undesirable. there was no good reason for making marijuana illegal. - for free quality education, i should probably edit what i said. there's no equal access to quality education past highschool, in part because of the cost. - the police force are a problem, but that's not just in the us. the way they're chosen and educated, their purpose isn't to protect and serve the people, it's to protect and serve those in power. the origins of the police was private militias meant to protect the property of the rich and protect the rich from the poor and the minorities by keeping them in check. that hasn't changed much. - i guess all those teachers who were protesting a couple of years ago were complaining about nothing right? i am angry, and to you i probably do seem insane, and maybe i am. but i'm not wrong and if these things don't make you angry then you're just an ostrich with it's head stuck in the ground who doesn't have the presence of mind to take a real hard look at what's happening past the borders of it's world (= the hole it's head is in).",1,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,59012,36,CovidVaccine

( those easily programmed automotons) most of me believes one corporation directs both the right and the left, including trump. melanias speech being so word for word the same as michelle obamas was mind blowing. but i am not ruling out that trump is actually cooperating with an intelligence coup to drain the world of corruption. i hope it do. but if not the people will find out when he plays that card, and i think its important to retain an open mind with these jokers. and have plans in case these jokers do go all out evil villain. i hope the angels in intelligence communities are sabotaging any nefarious plans. and from the outside i just figure it might look alot like what we are seeing. trumps grandfather dying from toxic vaccines in 1918 gives trump motive for vengeance to take down the same medical establishment cult that his grandfather was a casualty of. im just throwing this possibility out there.  i analyzed trumps 200 or so appointed judges and all appear to be relatively good fair people. the two supreme court justices were controversial, if anyone can paint a more accurate picture on them please help me out.  im not on the trump wagon until i see anderson pooper fired for culturally divisive propoganda. steven colbert trevor noah and all these automotons ... snl has long been infiltrated by cia assett asshattery. if all the talking heads get exposed as national liabilities i will be stoked. anyone who says the words the new normal should be flagged if pretty much all of propaganda hollywood and politics goes down, as well as fauci and the entire pharmaceutical industry... i just might get a trump shirt  but from what it looks like, trump is part of it all. jared kushner organized the shutdown. trump organized and appointed fauci and all these goons. the cdc guy might be a good guy but he certainly looks straight henchman. trump also appointed the fda guy and shortly after accuses him of being deep state. so much to wrap my mind around but i keep thinking that his grandfather dying from vaccines might be motive for him to instigate real change. im sure as a real estate mogul he gets tired of so many automotons being swayed one way or another. but his involvement in reality television makes me question whether he and all the others are acting. who wrote melanias speech and why was it identical to michelle obamas?",0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"1, I'm not sure of the argumentative goal but this seems to me a bit like a story rather than a mere description of events (not enough for a tag but it makes me unsure)",917,114,CovidVaccine

 were always talking about getting through this and figuring out what the new normal is, but im now thinking this is the new normal, bruce nash, box office analyst and founder of thenumbers, said. the virus doesnt really go away, and were in this wave of coronavirus cases subsiding and spiking and maybe theres a vaccine early next year, but this is how its going to be for as long as we can see right now.  california gov. gavin newsom on wednesday ordered los angeles county and 18 other counties in the state to close movie theaters and dine-in restaurant service for at least the next three weeks as infections continue to surge.  to boot, new york gov. andrew cuomo last week said that movie theaters will not reopen on schedule.  cinemark ceo mark zoradi said in a recent statement that the chains reopening plan was thoughtfully designed with multiple contingencies in place that enable us to efficiently adapt to todays ever-changing environment. he also remained confident based on the companys five-theater test run in dallas, texas.  we continue to pay close attention to the status of the virus, local mandates and availability of new content while prioritizing the health and safety of our guests, employees and communities, he said.  given the relative ease for studios to continue to delay releases or altogether shelve films, b. riley fbr analyst eric wold wrote in a recent note, because of the sparse slate of films, exhibitors are in an increasingly difficult position. theyre stuck between simply holding out on opening theaters until the release calendar is more certain, and re-hiring and opening anyway, but to minimal box office demand with older library films. the latter, wold wrote, would likely result in negative operating cash flows.  nash said cinema chains need to start thinking outside of the box (office).  we need to get more creative because youre not going to open up theaters for any level of regular operations anytime soon, he said. so do you say, were done. were just going to shut and down and well let you know when we reopen. or do you say, were going to figure out a way to, i dont know, do screenings in the parking lots of malls or something.  in the midst of the pandemic, where people are discouraged from going out among crowds, like at a movie theater, movie drive-ins have seen renewed interest and popularity. amazon is even hosting a summer movie drive-in series with michael b. jordans production company outlier society to celebrate diverse voices, starting in july.  cinema chains, nash suggested, could consider exploring pop-up style drive-ins while the future of movie theaters still remains uncertain.  although we continue to see a path toward more normalized attendance trends in late 2021 and into 2022, we believe the near-term film slate uncertainty reignites the focus on balance sheet liquidity for the exhibitor group, wold said in his note.  nash said its hard to imagine bigger theater chains reopening any time soon, except for maybe the smaller markets.  there are really only two potential saviors for the movie theater business: government action and the other is the studios, nash said, referencing studios helping to pay exhibitors digital print fees during the switch from film. what that looks like for putting tenet out in a movie theater, i dont know. but everybody in the industry wants that to happen its maybe more about what we do with the situation that were in.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,"1, this to me would not be storytelling w/o the context of the whole comment's intro, giving the event description extrinsic argumentative functions ",54696,106,CovidVaccine

friedman made similar arguments](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/opinion/coronavirus-economy.html?fbclid=iwar2j6da_uuuabrczej7vqtq0uydkuq5elicaakstv3bkbb_vmalhlsyp1_w). a few days before that, the

director of the yale-griffin prevention research center. the editorial board of the wall street journal recently [published an opinion piece that made a similar argument](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rethinking-the-coronavirus-shutdown-11584659154). while there is not yet a complete bipartisan consensus on this issue, it is concerning to see a large section of the u.s. elite so openly proclaiming their willingness to let millions die to further their political and economic interests. if people are rushed back to work before the pandemic has died down, or before there is a vaccine, this will lead to a massive outbreak and the unnecessary deaths of millions of people. this would be akin to responses during the 1918 flu pandemic in which some places rushed people back to work and hosted big public gatherings, which led to [massive spikes in the weekly death rate](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/2020/03/how-cities-flattened-curve-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic-coronavirus/). criticism of this push to get people back to work during the pandemic have primarily [focused on how this prioritizes profit over the lives and well-being of people](https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/03/27/i-will-not-kill-my-mother-for-your-stock-portfolio/). this is an important criticism. it exposes the logic of the present social system which serves the interests of the wealthy and powerful at the expense of the poor and oppressed people. these exposures are all the more important during times of crisis when so many are in dire straits both from the virus itself, and also the looming economic depression. however, it is also important to see that push to get everyone back to work is not just about driving the stock market higher and maximizing corporate profits. the u.s. elite have a series of economic and political interests which are related to, but not reducible to maximizing their profits and driving the stock market higher. for example, competition between the u.s. and china has been intensifying in recent years. this has manifested in many ways including the military build up in the south china sea, and the ongoing trade war. right now, the u.s. elite are worried that [the coronavirus could reshape the global order](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-03-18/coronavirus-could-reshape-global-order) and allow chinawhich seems to be recovering from the virusto overtake the u.s. as a the dominant

regions like the middle east at the expense of u.s corporations](https://www.rand.org/blog/2020/03/covid-19-impacts-on-strategic-dynamics-in-the-middle.html). they are also concerned that china could strengthen its relationship with [european countries like italy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/14/coronavirus-eu-abandoning-italy-china-aid/) by providing them with economic and medical assistance during this crisis. the push to get everyone back to work is also related to the u.s. elite's concerns about [major disruptions to global supply chains](https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/coronavirus/a-contagion-is-spreading-through-the-economy-too/). some key industries are already [shutting down some production](https://www.postandcourier.com/health/covid19/sc-automakers-temporarily-closing-manufacturing-plants-due-to-coronavirus-supply/article_25e08da2-6aa5-11ea-9056-af6c129aca07.html) due to supply shortages. there is [growing concern about what is known as the bullwhip effect](https://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2020/03/12/coronavirus-supply-and-demand-economic-effect) in supply chain engineering. the basic concept is that as one supplier attempts to adjust to new changes in demand and available parts, like those caused by the present crisis, relatively smaller misadjustments by this initial supplier can lead to even bigger miscalculations down-stream or upstream. the metaphor to the bullwhip is that a small change/disruptionlike a flick of the wristleads to bigger changes down the line, like the movement at the end of the whip. this is already playing out in multiple ways throughout the economy. for example, many hospitals have urgently been requesting supplies of personal protection equipment, such as masks and gloves. while there have been steps to address these shortagessuch as [automanufacturers shifting production to make ventilators and

scale, the initial outbreak of coronavirus in china and the related economic downturn there [led to major disruptions in production and supply](https://www.joc.com/maritime-news/trade-lanes/trans-pacific/coronavirus-could-delay-normal-post-cny-trans-pac-flow-march_20200210.html) of made goods made in china. this led to a [significant loss of profits to producers there](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-industrial-profits-iduskbn21e08i?taid=5e7da812e370aa0001622e7d). it also led to major [disruptions in supply for manufacturers around the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/business/hyundai-south-korea-coronavirus.html) who rely on parts and equipment made in china. following a partial recovery from the pandemic, many businesses and factories in china have quickly invested in the reopening of operations throughout the country, assuming that their international customers would purchase the same approximate quantity of goods that they did before the crisis. however, faced with [declines in demand because of economic crises in the u.s. and europe](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/the-second-virus-shockwave-is-hitting-china-s-factories-already), these factory owners may experience even further losses on investments. they are already beginning to face issues [due to reduced demand from europe, the u.s., and other parts of the world.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/the-second-virus-shockwave-is-hitting-china-s-factories-already) in the face of this downturn, some may overcompensate in other direction and drastically cut back production to a degree that leaves those who require their products with no choice but to look elsewhere, or to go out of business. howard shatz, a senior economist at the rand corporation [recently noted that the impact of production disruptions in europe on the u.s. economy will be even more significant than the impact of earlier disruptions in china](https://www.rand.org/blog/2020/03/the-economic-wallop-of-covid-19-qa-with-rand-experts.html). he stated, think about this: china is a major trading partner, and its shutdown negatively affected a lot of u.s. businesses. but the united states receives only 15 percent of its imports from china and sends only 7 percent of its exports to china. we send 34 percent of our exports to the eu and receive 30 percent of our imports from the eu. now those economies are shut down. our neighbors canada and mexico are also major trading partners with us, so our economic health will depend in part on theirs as well. given the non-linear nature of supply-chain disruptions, there is growing worry that economic disruption from the virus will lead to major shortages of important goods, [including a possible world-wide shortage of food](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns). this is growing concern because

sick](https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news/other/sailors-on-warships-like-uss-theodore-roosevelt-vulnerable-as-coronavirus-spreads/ar-bb11s7wv). these are just a few example of the complex series of reasons that trump and other members of the u.s. elite are pushing to get everyone in the u.s. back to work. the capitalists and politicians are of course concerned about the stock market and corporate profits, and it is important to critique them for [prioritizing profits over human lives and well being](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/03/capitalism-pandemic-coronavirus-covid-19-single-payer). this is an essential feature of capitalism, even during periods of relative stability. however, during a crisis the contradictions of the system intensify, and its logic is laid bare. its important to understand the complex dynamics at play and not oversimplify the situation. the maneuvers of the ruling elite not only show that they value profit over the lives of the poor and oppressed peoplesomething which they have made abundantly clear long before this crisisbut also that they are deeply concerned about how this crisis will impact their power, both geopolitically and domestically. in other words, the u.s. elites response to this crisis shows not only their greed and callous indifference, but also the fragility of their rule. for more of our updates, follow us on

more parts of the country, including athens. the steps came as greece recorded its second-highest daily infection numbers -- 254 new cases.","paris new flareups of covid-19 are disrupting the peak summer vacation season across much of europe, where authorities in some countries are reimposing restrictions on travelers, closing nightclubs again, banning fireworks displays and expanding mask orders even in chic resort areas. unfortunately, this virus doesnt play ball, british transport secretary grant shapps told sky news. the surges have spread alarm across europe, which suffered mightily during the spring but appeared in recent months to have largely tamed the coronavirus in ways that the u.s., with its vaunted scientific prowess and the extra time to prepare, cannot seem to manage. the continents hardest-hit countries, britain, italy, france and spain, have recorded about 140,000 deaths in all. in addition to clubs and alcohol-fueled street parties, large family gatherings usually abounding with hugs and kisses -- have been cited as a source of new outbreaks in several european countries. a new public awareness campaign by spains canary islands depicts a family gathering for a grandfathers birthday, with people taking off masks and embracing. the grandfather ends up in a hospital bed with covid-19. in france, thousands of vacationing britons scrambled to return home friday to avoid having to self-quarantine for 14 days following britains decision to reimpose restrictions on france because of a resurgence of infections there. ferries added extra trips back to england, and trains were running out of space. some of the toughest new measures were announced in spain, which has recorded almost 50,000 confirmed covid-19 cases in the past 14 days. health minister salvador illa, after an emergency meeting with regional leaders, said nightclubs nationwide were ordered to close. visits to nursing homes will be limited to one person a day for each resident for only one hour. we can't be undisciplined, illa said. in italy, also faced with a surge of cases, seaside towns announced new restrictions, including bans on fireworks at beaches. the moves came just ahead of italys biggest summer holiday, ferragosto, which millions of italians celebrate at the seashore, in the mountains or on trips abroad. the mayor of anzio banned all overnight access to the beach, while san felice circeo, a popular weekend getaway for romans, ordered masks worn outdoors. on the chic island of capri, an order requiring masks outdoors from evening to nearly dawn was expanded by the mayor to the entire day. masks also are now also required in the streets of amalfi, a picturesque coastal tourist town. with some of italys 200-plus infection clusters traced to patrons of crowded seaside dance clubs, the governor of calabria, the region that forms the toe of italy, ordered such nightspots closed. italy's health ministry said 574 new covid-19 cases were recorded on friday the highest daily number since may 28. the outbreaks and new restrictions in europe shouldnt come as a surprise, said josh michaud, associate director of global health policy with the kaiser family foundation in washington. even the smallest chink in the armor can lead to an outbreak if youre not careful, michaud said. in no country have we approached herd immunity, and we dont have a vaccine. in greece, authorities strongly recommended people wear masks for a week indoors and out in public areas after returning from domestic vacation destinations with a high covid-19 incidence. gatherings of more than nine people were prohibited on two popular greek resort islands, paros and antiparos, and a ban on restaurants, bars and nightclubs operating after midnight was expanded to more parts of the country, including athens. the steps came as greece recorded its second-highest daily infection numbers -- 254 new cases. in france, amid growing fears of a second spike of contagion, the head of the countrys national health service said paris and marseille have been declared at-risk zones. the situation is deteriorating from week to week, the official, jrme salomon, said on france inter radio. the british government said it was compelled to impose the quarantine requirement on people returning from france in light of a 66% increase in infections in france in the past week. the requirement applied to anyone returning after 4 a.m. on saturday. philip alston, who was looking after three cats for a french couple in paris, reluctantly decided to return to britain. fortunately, they said in the case of this happening, they had a stand-by helper, he said before boarding a eurostar train to london. so im really upset because i was having a good time looking after the cats and exploring paris. the quarantine decision is a big blow to frances tourism industry, which relies heavily on travelers from britain.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,49874,61,CovidVaccine

but nope, it's just a ""coincidence"" that the only level 4 biosafety laboratory in china is located a couple miles away from where this supposed ""bat with covid"" happened. this is the perfect virus to control people. half the people who get it don't even know they have it and the majority of the other cases are minor enough not to get tested and the testing is terrible, to begin with, so there is always that uncertainty of people who don't know if they've had it or not, and where there is uncertainty there is fear which makes it perfect to manipulate people and to cross lines in the name of ""public safety."" once those lines are crossed and freedoms and rights are taken away, they are never going to be returned. a perfect analogy for what i believe is happening is the frog in a pot of boiling water. you try to suddenly take people's freedoms, they are going to notice and resist. if you slowly turn the heat up and gradually take away their freedoms, they'll sit around unbothered until before they know it they don't have any freedoms at all. i am 100% in the boat and behind the idea that the pandemic is part of the great reset agenda that the world leaders have decided needs to be implemented by 2030. and i don't think that these people are necessarily ""evil"" or the covid vaccine is the ""mark of the beast"". i do believe that they are so out of touch with reality that they really believe the great reset is for the betterment of humanity and people will be okay with the idea of becoming a ""brick in the wall"" so to speak. the people who i have talked to and who are willing to hear me out basically have said to just ""do what makes you happy"" and to, ""ignore the messed-up world."" but i simply cannot ignore the fact that people have become mental slaves to the system and literally have lost their humanity. and i know for a fact there's a lot of things that are done behind the scenes by intelligence agencies and such that impact our lives in some way but society never recognizes it and i'm okay with that. however, it has never been more apparent to me that the ""pandemic"" and the nw agenda is being pushed in plain sight and that these things will permanently change how 99% of the rest of the world lives. i heard in the first ""pandemic"" documentary that the greatest weapon that the elites of the world have to push agendas is the citizens themselves, which i believe is true. once they brainwash the majority of the population they can let them do the rest of the work to further push their plan. those who question or peak their head up a little too high will be shut down by the rest of the brainwashed people. with the apparent censorship of basically everything nowadays this is more apparent than ever. i don't know if this is a rant but i just feel like i am in the right with what i believe and sadly i feel i'm a minority and people think i am out of touch with reality when in reality, they've been sucked in and they can not seem to take off their blinders. and normally, people are right, you have to ignore what happens in the world and control what you can control, but i think we have to be aware of how the world is changing because it's changing fast and not headed in a good direction and the best weapon to combat is knowledge and wisdom. am i the one who is out of touch with reality? am i in the wrong?",1,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,182,34,CovidVaccine

"" dod backs up vaccine makers like ino!"" "" stocks will surge with new funding and upcoming results!"" - in typical journalistic sensational hype ups for creating nifty headlines titles. the point is ""the devil is in the details"" as they say. back to the different 'cultures' of companies and people, many, many, many, of them have a very clearly defined, black and white, stance on animal rights, and the experimentation of animals. there is the caveat, and the boom up that strangely led to the unexpected, unprecedented, odd and against all logic, of why the stock plummeted right after what seems to everyone (and it is) a logical, no brainer, win and immensely positive factor for the stock so how is this possible? how can so much great news sandbag this beautiful, natural boost to the companies holdings? ows announces, after the initial high level dod funding announcement, the details. at the very least, headlines rolled out, now they dive into the details and by default we start learning about the details, after the honeymoon. many corporate cultures do not wish to be associated with certain acts deemed ""animal cruelty"" such as primate experimentation, especially at (what has been promoted as) a level of available resources that make it seem like monkeys and apes are simply needle cartridges that can be used and tossed as many times as they want- provided that they hurry this up and get the vaccina already. the political and financial aspects of ows overshadow the possibilities of this not being received well by many organizations and people. not at this scale, to say the least. innocently enough, this wasn't something ows actors foresaw. they do have the best intentions- to get this pandemic under control, to help the small companies financially and with resources, and to overall get this vaccine discovered and concocted as fast as possible.. for the benefit of humans, even if it is at the expense of infecting hundred or thousands of primates at a never-before-seen amount. we are america, we go big or go home the we are defintely front and center of all this political bs, and the country with the most ridiculously highest cases. stakes are high. these excess animals are now completely at the mercy of disease-riddled and dangerously high doses of an unknown virus medley of cocktails. we have no idea what the impact of this will have. yet, many don't care about the outcomes, at this point, once they knew what was coming and they just do not want to be a part of it. this has cause a major pivoting point that we clearly saw, without any logical reason to our knowledge of what the hell is happening, when we thought we were about to start hitting triple digit stock price numbers over the last weeknd until the halt that started seemingly out of no where! lastly, this is not to say that 'primate challenges' at a ridiculously ubsurd level of usage is the main culprit. as we saw, we survived what seemed to be a clear launch into orbit, being missiled by an unknown entity, as we scratched our heads and hit the social media comment sections ""speculating"" and driving ourselves nuts with so much data already known but that had absolutely nothing to do with it. the unforeseen, never discussed or even imagined, missile was culture. many companies pulled out quick. investors rolling their eyes after celebrating when they realized, ""oh shit we are going to infect thousands of monkeys and create thousands of carriers in a species that we have no idea if that will have scientific impact on the actual virus' traits?"" meaning, are we sure this is a good idea. well, too many of the impulsive buyers, they didn't think so and have to either pull out or explain the fine print, like, ""oh, by the way, you know that awesome money grab move we just invested hundreds of thousands in?? yeah....apparently. . .ummm,  yeaaaaaaah."" \it's not an easy sell to some of these corporate cultures. \ yes. animal experimentation is part of this process, in many cases. it's just never been publicized so callously and with such an expendable tone to it in headlines. of course, many are seeing and learning things they never thought about before and seeing there headlines and thinking twice about it due to the nature of this venture they embarked on. who the hell was 'wolf of wallstreet-ing"" small random previously unheard of vaccine companies before covid-19?? nobody! the ones we knew about were already coasting and unless you have millions of dollars to invest, they weren't even on our radar!! pfizer! j&j! astrazeneca! do we have money to buy thousands of their shares and invest at the prices they already were at in a pre-covid 19 market?? hell no. ino is small. everything going for them. all the milestones- beautiful. all the positive press- gov funding, bill and melinda gates foundation, cepi, and many more- all very positive impacts on the ascending stock and company. halt- the most odd unexpected thing happens on the sure shot blast to the moon out of nowhere. people of influence and certain leader types, and corporations, have a culture, and their bread and butter comes from people, that are not cool with animal cruelty. ows basically is handing out these living creatures and bags of cash and saying, ""go to town!"" cynical? no. it's just the truth. this will not thwart many others, is the flip side of this coin. we will continue to do well, provided the next peer-reviewed results come with good news. but as of this moment, the phase 1 conclusion, everything you will hear from them will be played safe. neither too positive and revealing or negative and concerning. and, to your point, the 100% of the process completion involves everything we already know plus the behemoth of news and milestones still to come. as a science industry company, all market and financial bs aside, ino's core principles and practices, and simply their discipline, is to not draw many conclusions until everything has been accounted for and tried, before giving a final go or no-go on an experiment's outcome. that means that, on the market and financial side which they still have an obligation to, they have to keep many people happy, that don't understand how these processes work, and have to tread carefully. while doing a delicate balance of staying on task and flowing protocol, they are now incentivised to change protocol, accelerate processes that goes against their creeds and doctrines, and all while talking money and with shareholders breathing down their neck, with operation warp speed knocking on their doors and introducing more distraction and pressure disguised as ""help"" and concern. this is a recipe for disaster. i have no doubt behind the scenes they will stay true to their doctrines, but this new acceptance of assistance comes with a price- now they are obligated to report to even more people, and those people, the government appointed vp, the directors and project managers of those gov funds, the liaisons, the animal people, the lawyers for this sector, the paper pushers jumping on this project, and the mass of changes and new chefs in the kitchen is not a good thing for inovio. if we need any proof or sign of what's to come, atleast in the ows's respect, we saw it early this week when we had an explosive awesome launch and we were sitting back in our chairs about to light a cigar, and like the space shuttle disaster that exploded 73 seconds into its flight after takeoff, we saw what followed what seemed like a glorious liftoff. keep an eye on this. not every shiny new thing is something we will find we like after a while of playing with it.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,592,62,CovidVaccine

hospital of philadelphia.","here you go you cheapskate  in 1918, a novel strand of influenza killed more people than the 14th centurys black plague. at least 50 million people died worldwide because of that h1n1 influenza outbreak. the dead were buried in mass graves. in philadelphia, one of the hardest-hit cities in the country, priests collected bodies with horse-drawn carriages. in the middle of todays novel coronavirus outbreak, some are turning to the conclusion of past pandemics to discern how and when life might return to normal. the washington post has received a few dozen questions from readers who want historical context for our current epidemic. but how did the deadliest pandemic ever recorded come to an end? over time, those who contracted the virus developed an immunity to the novel strand of influenza, and life returned to normal by the early 1920s, according to historians and medical experts. reports at the time suggest the virus became less lethal as the pandemic carried on in waves. but the strand of the flu didnt just disappear. the influenza virus continuously mutated, passing through humans, pigs and other mammals. the pandemic-level virus morphed into just another seasonal flu. descendants of the 1918 h1n1 virus make up the influenza viruses were fighting today. the 1918 flu is still with us, in that sense, said ann reid, the executive director of the national center for science education who successfully sequenced the genetic makeup of the 1918 influenza virus in the 1990s. it never went away. its not clear exactly how or where the 1918 influenza outbreak began, but, at some point, the novel h1n1 virus passed from birds to humans. from start to finish, the flu could burn through a town or city in a matter of weeks. very few people had ever contended with a concoction of influenza like this before, which is why it was so potent, reid said. even president woodrow wilson contracted the virus while negotiating the end of world war i. seasonal influenza tends to kill the oldest and youngest in a society but in 1918, roughly half of those who died were men and women in their 20s and 30s. people were getting sick and dying in the prime of their lives. as many as 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then living may have been killed by the virus, historian john m. barry wrote in his best-selling book the great influenza. stay safe and informed with our free coronavirus updates newsletter all the while, world war i continued. the bloody trench warfare across europe left 8.5 million or more soldiers dead. the tight quarters during the war only aided the spread of the virus, said howard markel, a physician and medical historian at the university of michigan. the 1918 outbreak has been called the spanish flu because spain, which remained neutral during world war i, was the first country to publicly report cases of the disease. china, france and the united states already had cases of the flu, but wartime censorship largely kept the outbreaks out of the newspapers. then, the king of spain alfonso xiii and several other members of his government contracted the flu. this series of unfortunate events left a permanent mark, tying the country to the deadly outbreak. there was a very common habit, which has persisted to this day, of blaming an epidemic on one country or one group of people, markel said. it goes back centuries. spain hated being linked to the deadly 1918 flu pandemic. trumps chinese virus label echoes that. the longer the influenza virus existed in a certain community, the less lethal the sickness was. an epidemiological study cited by barry in the great influenza noted that the virus was most virulent or most readily communicable when it first reached the state, and thereafter it became generally attenuated. experts say theres this natural progression where a virus often but not always becomes less lethal as time wears on. its in the best interest of the virus for it to spread before killing the host. the natural order of an influenza virus is to change, barry told the post. it seems most likely that it simply mutated in the direction of other influenza viruses, which is considerably milder. by 1920, the influenza virus was still a threat, but fewer people were dying from the disease. some scientists at the time started to move on to other research. barry wrote that william henry welch, a famous pathologist from johns hopkins who was studying the virus, found it humiliating that the outbreak was passing away without experts truly understanding the underlying cause of the disease. what welch didnt predict was that the virus never truly went away. in 2009, david morens and jeffery taubenberger two influenza experts at the national institutes of health co-authored an article with anthony s. fauci explaining how the descendants of the 1918 influenza virus have contributed to a pandemic era that has lasted the past hundred years. at the time the article was published, the h1n1 influenza virus in public circulation was a fourth-generation descendant of the novel virus from 1918. all those pandemics that have happened since 1957, 1968, 2009 all those pandemics are derivatives of the 1918 flu, taubenberger told the post. the flu viruses that people get this year, or last year, are all still directly related to the 1918 ancestor. because of this, the 1918 influenza outbreak doesnt come with a neat bookend. society moved on, but the virus continued in some form or fashion. we are living in a pandemic era that began around 1918, taubenberger wrote with fauci and morens back in 2009 for the new england journal of medicine. ever since 1918, this tenacious virus has drawn on a bag of evolutionary tricks to survive. we continue to turn back to the 1918 outbreak as a point of comparison, said jeremy greene, a historian of medicine at johns hopkins. some of the public health measures a hundred years ago are still put in place today. to flatten the curve, cities and towns have more or less shut down. that said, greene cautions against drawing the parallels too closely. there are similarities to draw between todays pandemic and the influenza outbreak a hundred years ago. both come from winged animals one from birds and the other from bats. both are respiratory viruses. both led people to wear masks in public. both forced cities and schools to shut down for periods of time. and, finally, in both cases, the countrys leaders exacerbated problems by ignoring the early warning signs. despite all that, influenza viruses and coronaviruses are not the same. theres very little someone can draw from influenza to then provide treatment for the infectious disease named covid-19, said paul offit, the director of the vaccine education center at childrens hospital of philadelphia. theyre really different viruses, offit added. influenza is consistent and relatively quick when compared with the novel coronavirus. if you get exposed to the flu, youll start showing symptoms in one to four days after the infection. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, it tends to take five days for those infected with sars-cov-2 to start showing symptoms of covid-19, but the timing can fluctuate from two days to two weeks. the novel coronavirus is not moving on the same time frame as the 1918 influenza, greene told the post. everything is longer with the novel coronavirus the symptoms, the sickness and even the long-term complications. doctors are concerned covid-19 can lead to lasting cardiovascular complications. then there are asymptomatic carriers of the disease. that one detail makes it harder to mitigate the spread of the virus by simply taking temperatures. symptoms are not a be-all-end-all solution to tracking the disease. with that in mind, the novel coronavirus is acting more like polio, where those with mild cases dont know theyre sick, greene said. it immediately raises a different set of problems for managing a disease, greene said. one needs to relearn the way to think about who is dangerous, and that becomes, basically, everybody. recognizing both the similarities and differences to past pandemics can provide a meaningful mirror for the present, greene added. the million-dollar question is: what can the 1918 influenza outbreak tell us about how our current pandemic may end? the sad answer is not very much, markel said. the operative word in this particular pandemic is novel coronavirus. were learning as we go along, but we dont really know that

how long does it last? do some patients fail to mount the right response? does the virus damage the immune system? and are reinfected people infectious to others?  danny altmann, professor of immunology at imperial college in london, guesses that those who recover from covid-19 will have perhaps 90% protection for a fair while. but how long is that? i would bet my house on you being safe for possibly a year but not much longer, he said. the problem is that whenever an immunologist says anything about covid immunity to a journalist, its right for about two weeks and then its completely wrong.   reinfections may be worse for a whole host of reasons. the person might have been exposed to more virus the second time around, or may simply have been under the weather already when the virus struck again.  another possibility is so-called antibody-dependent enhancement a glitch in the immune system where antibodies help an invading virus rather than hinder it. this is seen in dengue fever where second infections can be far more dangerous than the first.  yet another possibility is that the virus harms t-cells, in some patients at least. we need to study the t-cells, said swapneil parikh, who worked with shastri on reinfected hospital workers. is the virus doing something to the immune system that is setting you up for more severe infections?  the virus can certainly disrupt the immune system. in august, shiv pillai, an immunologist at the ragon institute of massachusetts general hospital, examined tissue taken from dead covid-19 patients. he looked for structures called germinal centres in the spleen and lymph nodes. these are where b-cells go to develop antibodies before they are stored in the immune systems memory. pillai failed to find any, suggesting the patients were unable to generate highly effective, long-lasting antibodies that would fight the virus for years.  he believes the same problem may arise in people with milder covid-19 too. if we want antibodies that will persist for a few years and protect us, its not clear thats going to happen, he said. the good news is that a vaccine should not cause the same problem as the virus. i dont see why the vaccines wont work. they may not be fantastic, but i believe thats whats going to protect us, he said.  if the virus spreads further through the autumn and winter, iwasaki expects to see more reinfections, with some patients infectious enough to pass the virus on.  according to stephen reicher, professor of social psychology at the university of st andrews, and a member of the behavioural science subgroup of sage, that poses another problem. people who have recovered from covid-19, and many who falsely believe they had it, may believe they are protected in the second wave. i think it is important, all ways round, to dispel the myth of invulnerability, he said.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,37809,197,CovidVaccine

it was up to me, he later wrote, to gather all the peoples of the world into this new faith. mr. okawa returned to tokyo, where he tapped into the citys burgeoning metaphysical scene and attracted a following. playing on the economic anxiety of the early 1990s, he self-published several tracts with titles like the terrifying revelations of nostradamus and the great warnings of allah. the books were hits. and as more flooded out, the tales became more and more dazzling. at first mr. okawa was just a channel for far-flung spirits. then he was a reincarnated buddha. eventually he proclaimed himself the supreme deity of this world. and remarkably, his followers agreed. life on earth, mr. okawa came to teach, was engineered millions of years ago by a creator god from venus named el cantare who had been reincarnated over the years as deities and enlightened masters, like hermes, thoth from atlantis, odin, buddha and an incan king named rient arl croud. the latest incarnation of el cantare, of course, was mr. okawa himself. soon, happy science would fill stadiums with ceremonies that blended theatrical cosplay and what looked like revelation. mr. okawa might leap from a mock u.f.o., clad in feathery angel wings as smoke machines billowed. between the growing media franchise and fees and donations, mr. okawas project made him exceptionally rich. by some estimates, happy science had revenues of $45 million a year. but there was always a dark side, never far from the surface. in the mid-1990s, happy sciences rivalry with another doomsday group, aum shinrikyo, took an ugly turn. aum first tried to assassinate mr. okawa, then later launched an attack on the tokyo subway with sarin nerve gas, killing 13 and injuring thousands. yet where other enterprising messiahs fell aside, mr. okawa persisted. happy science has since opened private schools in japan, and in 2009 it branched into politics, with a right-wing platform that has seen limited success in local elections. mr. okawa has continued to churn out books, which now number more than 2,000, most of them transcriptions of lectures. a film division also puts out feature-length anime. meanwhile, happy science has left scores of disaffected members in its wake. opponents accuse the group of fleecing acolytes in what they say amounts to a pyramid scheme. much to the embarrassment of mr. okawa, his own son hiroshi (once primed as a successor) is now one of happy sciences most vocal critics. hiroshi okawa, in a message, said of his father: he claimed to have received the messages of god, he relentlessly lied to his followers. he added, i believe what my father does is complete nonsense. happy sciences claims of 11 million members also seem unlikely. when mr. okawas first wife, kyoko, left the group in 2011 she estimated real membership was 30,000. for his part, mr. okawa denounced his estranged family as demonic. he has since remarried. so, troubled at home, the happies have set sights on america, where they have found a receptive, if modest, welcome. in 2008, happy science purchased a manhattan townhouse and, after renovations, installed its north american headquarters here, relocating from a small office in new jersey. for the grand opening, mr. okawa flew in with his entourage to hold an inaugural lecture that packed the sanctuary and an overflow room downstairs. the building is on a shaded tribeca alley, sandwiched incongruously between espresso cafes and designer boutiques. looped videos of mr. okawas lectures play on a large screen facing the street. one afternoon before the shutdown in new york, yushi hagimoto, the head minister in the city, sat in the foyer tidying up wares. glittering amulets and jewelry were for sale. a golden statue of el cantare, his face modeled on mr. okawas, sat at the dimmed central altar. hundreds of happy science texts lined the shelves, with titles like alien invasion, 7 future predictions, spiritual message from the guardian spirit of donald trump, and so on. the books about demons are very popular, mr. hagimoto said. when news broke this year about a deadly virus spreading from china, happy science was quick to pivot to this novel cataclysm. beginning in january, mr. okawa claimed to receive messages from a trio of extraterrestrials going by the unfamiliar names r.a. goal, metatron and yaidron and the spirits of chinese leaders, including xi jinping. ( the guardian angels of boris johnson, john lennon and angela merkel also sent transmissions.) according to happy science, the virus was created as a bioweapon by the chinese government in wuhan, and then, in a twist, it was unleashed by a u.f.o. to punish the communists for their godless ways. it has spread to other lands that lack true faith. this material was quickly published as three booklets in japanese and has now been translated in english this month as spiritual reading of novel coronavirus infection originated in china. but there is hope for the faithful, the happies say. along with the book series, they now sell coronavirus-themed dvds and cds of mr. okawa lecturing; the sound alone of his voice is meant to hold immune-boosting power. in one video clip, mr. okawa advised, you must knock out the coronavirus with your el cantare belief. in another, it will become like, out with the demons, in with the good fortune. mr. okawa also introduced the sacred text of a new ritual purported to miraculously cure the disease. it is conducted in private at temples, in exchange for donations. japanese ads list several prices for virus-related blessings, going from $100 to more than $400. numerous members of the tribeca congregation have requested the coronavirus prayer. its amazing, mr. hagimoto said. were seeing people being cured. in the early days of the virus, happy science had proudly kept its manhattan doors open for business even as some churches closed. but as infections in the city soared, the temple announced that it would lock up.",1,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,79311,87,CovidVaccine
47,"some patients have guillain-barre syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease that interferes with nerve signals, leading to abnormal sensations, weakness, and sometimes paralysis  ##long-haulers dont feel like theyve recovered  they have a name, a growingsocial media presence, and a problem.","this article is being posted in full from [source link here](https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/17/what-we-now-know-about-covid19-and-what-questions-remain-to-be-answered/)please consider visiting the link to both support the site aswell as their journalist/authors  written byandrew joseph@drewqjoseph,helen branswell@helenbranswell,andelizabeth cooney@cooney_liz the before times seem like a decade ago, dont they? those carefree days when hugging friends and shaking hands wasnt verboten, when we didnt have to reach for a mask before leaving our homes, or forage for supplies of hand sanitizer. oh, for the days when social distancing wasnt part of our vernacular. in reality, though, its only been about seven months since the world learned a new and dangerous coronavirus was in our midst. in the time since chinese scientists confirmed the rapidly spreading disease in wuhan was caused by a new coronavirus and posted its genetic sequence on line, an extraordinary amount has been learned about the virus, sars-cov-2, the disease it causes, covid-19, and how they affect us. here are some of the things we have learned, and some of the pressing questions we still need answered.  #what we know  ##covid and kids: its complicated  early in the pandemic, it looked like there was a silver lining to the disease cloud sweeping across the world. children, it seemed, didnt develop the severe symptoms that were sending adults to hospitals struggling for breath, and they very rarely died. it even seemed that kids didnt contract the disease at the same rates as adults did.  but everything covid is complex, and kids are no exception. while deaths among children and teens remain low, they are not invulnerable. and they probably contribute to transmission of sars-cov-2, though how much remains unclear.  weve learned younger children and teenagers shouldnt be lumped together when it comes to covid. teens seem to shed virus emit it from their throats and nasal passages at about the same rates as adults. kids under 5 have high levels of virus in their respiratory tracts, but its still not clear how much they spread it or why they dont develop symptoms as often as adults do.  a recentlypublished reportfrom a georgia sleep-away camp shows how quickly the virus can spread among kids. the camp had to be closed within 10 days of starting its orientation for camp staffers, because within days of children arriving, kids and staff started getting sick. ( the campers ranged in age from 6 to 19.) the camp did not require campers to wear face masks.  arecent reporton covid infections in children from the centers for disease control and prevention showed that while they remain low, u.s. hospitalization rates for covid-19 in children have risen since the pandemic started. and one in three children hospitalized with the disease ends up in intensive care. the highest rate of hospitalizations in children was among those under 2 years of age.  black and latino children were hospitalized at higher rates than white children. and like adults, children with other health conditions obesity, chronic lung diseases, or infants who were born premature are at higher risk than otherwise healthy children.  perhaps most alarmingly, its become clear that a small proportion of children infected with covid-19 go on to develop a condition where multiple organs come under attack from their own immune system. called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children ormis-c, this condition seems to occur about two to four weeks after covid-19 infection. most children who develop this syndrome recover.  ##there are safer settings, and more dangerous settings  research has coalesced on a few key points about what types of setting increase the risk that an infectious person will pass the virus to others. essentially, the closer you are to someone infectious and the longer youre in contact with them, the more likely you are to contract the virus, which helps explain whyso much transmissionoccurs within households. being indoors is worse, particularly in rooms without sufficient ventilation; the more air flow, the faster the virus gets diluted. everyday face coverings reduce the amount of virus projected, but arent total blockades.  loud talking, heavy breathing, singing, and screaming expel more virus, which is why experts point to nightclubs and gyms as risky businesses to be open. ( thats not to say its impossible to catch the virus while having a quiet conversation with someone outside its just less likely.) the reason having prolonged, proximate contact with someone is riskier is in part because there is a threshold level of virus you need to be exposed to to become infected. ( more on this later.) also, one hypothesis for why some people get so sick is that they are exposed to higher doses of virus.  researchers are also finding that some relatively small proportion of infected people maybe 10% to 20% are driving some 80% of new cases, often through superspreading events in indoor settings like bars, meat processing plants, and homes.  whether such transmission occurs depends on a host of variables: how many people are in a given place, what the ventilation in the room is like, and, of course, whether someone with infectious covid-19 is there. some people might shed more virus than others, and people are more or less likely to spread the virus during different points in their infection. evidence suggests that contagiousness spikes in the days before people who will go on to show symptoms start feeling sick.  ##people can test positive for a long time after they recover. it doesnt matter  there was a lot of angst a few months ago about some people who had seemingly recovered from covid-19 infections continuing to test positive for the virus for weeks. were they infectious? should recommendations be changed for how long infected people should be isolated?  it turns out it is an issue of testing. most testing is conducted using a platform called pcr polymerase chain reaction that looks for tiny fragments of the sars-cov-2 virus. but the test cant tell if those sections of genetic code are part of actual viruses that can infect someone else, or fragments of viruses that are absolutely no threat.  its clear now that people who had mild or uncomplicated infections shed active virus for somewhere up to 10 days after their symptoms started. ( severely ill or immunocompromised patients do shed infectious virus for longer, said malik peiris, a coronavirus expert at hong kong university.)  the weeks and weeks of positive tests like those that preventedthis woman in quebecfrom cuddling her infant son for 55 days dont tell us that these people are still a risk to others. in fact, we know that they are not infectious for that long, said maria van kerkhove, the world health organizations leading coronavirus expert.  ##after the storm, there are often lingering effects  name a body part or system and covid-19 hasleft its fingerprints there.we know this: unusually sticky blood can clog vessels on the way to the heart and inside the brain and lungs of infected people, causing heart attacks, strokes, and deadly pulmonary embolisms. there are growing worries that these and other health effects will be long-lasting.  heart: the hyperinflammation of an immune response triggered by the virus can weaken heart muscles so much that even young people who had mild infections may be at risk for future heart failure,cardiac mris in germanyindicate. more immediately, some people havechest pain or feel like their hearts are racingas they recover from the infection. andcollege athletesare no exception brain: people whose first covid-19 symptom might have been losing their sense of smell and taste may find theiranosmiapersists. headaches and dizziness are common. mood disorders such as anxiety, depression, and ptsd follow in the wake of infection, and themental confusion called covid fogleaves people searching for words, struggling with simple math, or simply trying to think.  peripheral nervous system: in italy,three covid-19 patientsexperienced myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder, possibly due to demyelination. demyelination, in which the protective coating of nerve cells is attacked by the immune system, can cause weakness, numbness, and tingling. in some cases it can spur psychosis and hallucinations. some patients have guillain-barre syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease that interferes with nerve signals, leading to abnormal sensations, weakness, and sometimes paralysis  ##long-haulers dont feel like theyve recovered  they have a name, a growingsocial media presence, and a problem. they are the long-haulers, people who have survived their covid-19 infections but feel a long way from normal. we know theyre out there, but we dont know how many, why their symptoms persist, and what happens next.  in july, asurveyconducted by the cdc found that 35% of people who tested positive for sars-cov-2 and had symptoms of covid-19 cough, fatigue, or shortness of breath but were not hospitalized had not returned to their previous health two to three weeks later. among those between 18 and 34 years old who had no previous chronic conditions, 20% felt prolonged signs of illness.  the national heart, lung, and blood institute has launched an observationalstudyto track the long-term effects of covid-19, aiming to follow 3,000 patients six months after being discharged from 50 hospitals.  mount sinai health system in new york city opened acenter for post-covid carein may to treat long-haulers. david putrino, director of rehabilitation innovation there, has suggested dysautonomia when heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature are disjointed could be to blame for prolonged and distressing symptoms. why covid-19 would cause this isnt known, nor is the best treatment.  ##vaccine development can be accelerated. a lot  the world still doesnt have a vaccine that has been shown to be protective against covid-19, though china and russia have issued emergency use licenses for partially tested vaccines.  but an extraordinary amount of progress toward covid-19 vaccines has been made, in record time. trials have beencompressed and overlapped, with manufacturers running phase 1/2 trials in some cases and phase 2/3 trials in others.  meanwhile, theyve been building out production capacity to be able to produce hundreds of millions of doses and have started production, even before finding out whether their vaccine candidate actually works. this work is being done with substantial financial support of governments, the bill and melinda gates foundation, and cepi, the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations.  its called at risk production and the term is apt. if some of these vaccines dont work, that output will have to be junked. but if phase 3 trials show they do work, deployment could begin as soon as the food and drug administration, or a regulator in another country, approves any of these vaccines.  that means vaccination with fully approved vaccines could begin as soon as about a year after the discovery of the new virus. this constitutes a revolution in vaccine development.  ##people without symptoms can spread the virus  discussing asymptomatic cases of covid-19 automatically raises some headache-inducing semantic issues. some people are truly asymptomatic throughout their infections, but the word is often also used to describe people who are presymptomatic those who will show symptoms but havent yet. other people dont show classic covid-19 symptoms fever, cough, loss of smell but just feel kinda crappy for a day. where do they fit in?  whatever group youre talking about, there are some key implications for the pandemic, and trying to rein it in.  one: some percentage of infected people roughly 20%, according toone recent review, though other studies have produced higher estimates do not show symptoms at all.  and two: whether or not someone is asymptomatic or presymptomatic, they can still spread the virus (though whether they spread it as efficiently as people with symptoms is still unknown). that is why public health campaigns have been stressing distancing, masks, and hand hygiene for everyone, not just people who feel sick. once you do start showing symptoms and try to restrict contact with others, it is too late to prevent spread.  ##mutations to the virus havent been consequential  coronaviruses in general do not mutate very quickly compared to other viral families. this is a good thing: the leading vaccine candidates, for example, are based on sars-cov-2s genetic sequence, so theoretically a major change in that lineup could hinder the effectiveness of any vaccine. so far, that doesnt seem to have happened.  still, scientists have noticed smaller changes in the genome. the one that has gotten the most attention was one swap in the letters that make up the virus rna, which created the g variant. the switch happened early in the pandemic, and the g variant has since become dominant around the world. scientists havent been able to figure out, however, whether the g variant is outcompeting its predecessor perhaps its more contagious? or if thats just chance. and so far, they havent landed on evidence that people who contract the g variant get more or less sick than those infected by the other variant. it could just be a mutation thats like changing your t-shirt from navy blue to royal blue an aesthetic difference, but something pretty neutral.  ##viruses on surfaces probably arent the major transmission route  throughout the spring, you could barely find hand sanitizer. fears that viruses lurking on surfaces could infect us with covid-19 turned most of us into zealous surface cleaners. some people went so far as to quarantine their mail, not touching it for days as they waited for potential lingering viruses to die.  the general consensus now is that fomites germs on surfaces arent the major transmission route for covid-19. van kerkhove of who said there hasnt been a case recorded where its clear someone was infected by fomites alone.  (in the real world, someone in close enough contact with an infected person to become infected will likely have encountered viruses on surfaces and virus-laced droplets and maybe even small, aerosol-sized particles containing the virus that have been expelled by coughing, singing, or speaking. teasing out of that situation which route of transmission triggered infection may be impossible to do.)  but its clear from lots of studies that surfaces around infected people can be contaminated with viruses and the viruses can linger. cleaning surfaces and being prudent about hand hygiene is a risk-lowering step people can take, public health officials agree.  #what we dont know  ##people seem to be protected from reinfection, but for how long?  the thinking is that a case of covid-19, like other infections, will confer some immunity against reinfection for some amount of time. but researchers wont know exactly how long that protection lasts until people start getting covid-19 again. so far, despite some anecdotal reports, scientists have not confirmed any repeat covid-19 cases. all that supports the notion that covid-19 acts like other viral infections, including illnesses caused by other coronaviruses. researchers are finding that most infected people mount an immune response involving both antibodies and immune cells that clears the virus, and that persists for some amount of time. reports of waning antibody levels incited some concern that perhaps protection to sars-cov-2 might not last very long, with big implications for the frequency of required vaccine boosts. but immunologists havepointed outthat antibodies for other viruses wane as well; their levels surge upon re-exposure to the pathogen and they can still halt reinfection.  researchers dont know for sure what level of antibodies are required to block the virus from gaining a toehold in cells, and what role pathogen-fighting t cells might have in fending off an infection. people who recover from covid-19 also produce varying levels of antibodies its possible people who generate a weaker initial immune response might not be protected for as long from reinfection.  we dont know for how long that immune response lasts, the whos van kerkhove said last week. we also still dont know how strong it is.  ##what happens if or when people start having subsequent infections?  given that most respiratory viruses are not one-and-done infections they dont induce life-long immunity in the way a virus like measles does there is a reasonable chance that people could have more than one infection with covid-19.  experience with human coronaviruses which mostly cause colds supports that idea. astudy in the netherlandsfollowed people for decades, measuring their antibodies to four human coronaviruses at regular intervals and looking for changes that would indicate a new infection. the scientists found that reinfection could occur within a year of the first infection. ( the study is a preprint, meaning it hasnt yet been through the peer review process.)  some scientistshave theorizedthat on subsequent infections, immune systems might mount quicker responses to covid-19, leading to milder infections. if thats true, the sars-cov-2 virus might transition into a less daunting threat over time. but its still a big unknown. we dont know, van kerkhove said. i dont want to speculate.  ##how much virus does it take to get infected?  whether you become infected or not when you encounter a pathogen isnt just a question of whether youre susceptible or immune. it depends on how much of the virus (or bacterium) you encounter.  and the amount capable of tipping the balance is whats known as the minimum infectious dose. some pathogens have a low infectious dose. for example, it doesnt take a lot of e. coli 0157, a dangerous bacterium transmitted in food, to make someone sick.  how big a dose of sars-cov-2 does it take to infect most people? its one of the burning questions in sars-cov-2 research, said angela rasmussen, a coronavirus expert at columbia university. we dont know the amount that is required to cause an infection, but it seems that its probably not a really, really small amount, like measles.  ##how many people have been infected?  there have been 21 million confirmed cases of covid-19 around the world, and 5.3 million in the united states. far more people than that have actually had the virus.  problems with testing, and its limited availability, have contributed to that gap, as has the fact that some people have such mild or no symptoms that they dont know theyre infected. but researchers dont know just how big of a gulf theyre dealing with how much spread theyve missed.  serosurveys which rely on testing for the level of sars-cov-2 antibodies in a community are starting to help fill in some knowledge.a recent cdc studyof 10 cities and states estimated that in most places, the true number of infections was some 10 times higher than the number of confirmed cases.  still, that leaves perhaps 20% of people, even in hard-hit communities, with potential immunity to covid-19. that means that herd immunity the point at which so many people are immune that the virus cant circulate remains far off even in areas that have suffered severe outbreaks.  ##its not clear why some people get really sick, and some dont  the sheer range of outcomes for people who get covid-19 from a truly asymptomatic case, to mild symptoms, to moderate disease leading to months-long complications, to death has befuddled infectious disease researchers.  there are some clear factors for who faces higher risks of getting severely ill: older people, as well as peoplewith conditionsranging from cancer to obesity to sickle cell disease.  but scientists have postulated that a host of other underlying factors could help dictate why most healthy 30-year-olds shake off the virus after a couple days and some get severely ill. researchers are studying genetic differences in patients, while others are looking at blood type.  recent studies have also pointed to another potential player. perhaps up to half the population has immune-system t cells that were initially generated in response to an infection by one of the common cold-causing coronaviruses but that can recognize sars-cov-2 as well. these cross-reactive t cells could help give the immune system the boost it needs to stave off serious symptoms, but researchers dont know for sure what role, if any, they actually play",1,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0,919,56,CovidVaccine

54,clara van de wiel 24 may 2020 at 23:18 reading time 2 minutes    pharmacists thwarted a proposal from the european commission two years ago to use european research funds to better prepare for epidemics.,"european commission an eu study on better preparedness for epidemics did not go ahead due to lack of support from the pharmaceutical industry. clara van de wiel 24 may 2020 at 23:18 reading time 2 minutes    pharmacists thwarted a proposal from the european commission two years ago to use european research funds to better prepare for epidemics. this is evident from research by the brussels-based lobby watchdog corporate europe observatory (ceo) into the influence of large companies on european research policy. the commission wanted to launch a research line in 2018 that would facilitate the development of vaccines in preparation for an epidemic. however, due to the lack of support from the pharmaceutical industry, this did not happen.  ceo investigated how the industry influences the distribution of european research funds. the report shows how, through so-called public-private partnerships, companies are succeeding in influencing the question of research and using the results for their own gain.  within the academic world there have long been concerns about the increasing dependence on external financiers. in an nrc survey of more than 2,500 scientists in 2018, more than half said they were concerned about undesired influence by external financiers.  through the horizon programme, the european commission is a major financier of scientific research. the total volume of the programme over the past seven years was approximately 70 billion euros, of which about 8 percent went to dutch research. tens of billions will again be set aside for european research funding in the eu's new multi-year budget, which is currently being negotiated by the member states.  part of that money will go to so-called 'joint ventures' with industry. both parties put in money for this, with the aim of carrying out research that will benefit both society and the companies involved. over the past seven years, approximately 7 billion euros of european money has gone to the joint ventures.  social issues the programmes are intended to find solutions to social issues, such as underexposed diseases that mainly affect poor parts of the world. but ceo concludes that companies in particular have a great deal of influence in setting priorities. in this way, they succeed in using public money for research that they themselves wanted to carry out anyway. moreover, the results do not always benefit the public interest. for example, ceo describes a line of research into the cheaper production of an hiv inhibitor that would have been used by the pharmaceutical company sanofi to reduce the production costs of its own cancer drug.  in a reaction, a commission spokesman states that the cooperation programmes are subject to strict rules and that scientists are involved in monitoring. the commission also points out that in recent years european funding has gone into research into virus outbreaks and that it has taken a leading role in funding corona research.  nevertheless, the ceo's report is in line with criticism that has been voiced in the european parliament for some time.

58,"wuhan is a major manufacturing hub, especially in auto and fiber optics; one local company is the largest maker of the cables that carry data around the planet.","https://archive.is/qvfor march 2while it is too early, as we go to press, to know whether or not the coronavirus epidemic that broke out late last year in china has spread into a global pandemic, one thing is clear. while the outbreak created huge challenges for china, the largest and most powerful of the states where capitalism has been overthrown, that countrys push to contain the coronavirus underscores the vast superiority of a collectivized economy, however mismanaged by the ruling chinese communist party (ccp) bureaucracy. in the u.s., where health care is subject to the blind forces of production for private profit, the capitalist rulers have dismally failed to take basic measures to control outbreaks of the disease, covid-19. not surprisingly, the virus seems to have been circulating for weeks undetected in the suburbs of seattle and perhaps elsewhere in the country, endangering many lives. the new coronavirus is the third of its kind believed to have made the jump from animals to humans in the past two decades, following the viruses associated with sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2002 and mers (middle east respiratory syndrome) in 2012. wild animal food markets are the suspected origin of both the sars outbreak and the current one. much about covid-19 is not known. as of yet, there is no specific antiviral treatment, and the development, testing and production of a vaccine will likely take a year or more. as of today, the disease has reportedly killed over 3,000 people worldwide and infected nearly 90,000, although the actual numbers, especially of the latter, are likely much higher. most victims have been in the chinese city of wuhan, where the disease was first identified, and the surrounding province of hubei. despite initial bureaucratic inertia and outright cover-ups, beijing has made herculean efforts at containment through quarantines, a regional lockdown of some 60 million people, the severe curtailing of travel and the closure of factories and schools in much of the country. chinas government has also allocated significant medical and other resources to fight the disease. these measures appear to have had some success, and the rate of new cases within the country has begun to fall. the head of a world health organization (w.h.o.) delegation that went to wuhan and other cities in china praised its all-government, all-society approach as probably the most ambitious and agile in history. he declared: the world is in your debt (south china morning post, 24 february). the logistics of controlling this disease would be very difficult for any country, no matter how wealthy. when epidemics strike, public health measures are required that are sometimes drastic and intrusive but essential to save lives. especially when no vaccine or reliable treatment is available, measures like quarantine, the halting of transport and the cancellation of public events are the best available means to impede the spread of the disease. thus, these measures taken by china to combat covid-19, although belated, have been vitally necessary. so is the just-announced immediate and comprehensive ban on the wildlife food industry, valued at $74 billion. covid-19 hits capitalist world the chinese bought time for other countries to get ready to combat the disease. but as one u.s. health security expert acknowledged, we didnt make good use of that time and now were heading into a very dangerous situation. in the event of a full-blown covid-19 epidemic in the u.s., the country is poised to experience acute shortages of hospital beds, ventilators, surgical masks and other protective equipment. already, problems with the manufacture and distribution of diagnostic kits has stalled testing for the infection and hamstrung treatment efforts. unions representing hospital, airport and other service workers have raised demands for proper training and outfitting to reduce the risk of transmission. yesterday, two health care workers in california tested positive after they were exposed to an infected patient. washington also displayed complete disregard for the threat of contagion when it evacuated 14 infected americans from japan on a commercial flight with hundreds of passengers. those americans had been onboard the diamond princess, a cruise ship put in quarantine in the harbor of yokohama, only for japanese officials to have the sick mix with the healthy, including crew members. thus, dozens more were infected. subsequently, all passengers were allowed to leave the ship even though they might later develop symptoms. other capitalist governments have not done much better. thousands have lined up outside south korean stores to buy surgical masks, which are not widely available due to hoarding and price markups by manufacturers. in italy, which has also seen a scramble for supplies, the disease has broken out in areas near milano and venice, chiefly in hospitals. nonetheless, health care personnel there are being refused testing unless they have spent at least one hour in close contact with someone known to have covid-19. last week, a planned press conference by the governor of the lombardy region to announce a return to normalcy was canceled and the room evacuated when it emerged that his main aide had just tested positive and that the governor had decided to self-quarantine. the outbreak in iran will be particularly difficult to control, as draconian u.s. sanctions have devastated the economy and health care system. it certainly did not help matters when the reactionary islamic regime made no attempt to shut down the shrines and gathering places in the shia pilgrimage site of qom, the countrys hub of the disease. pilgrims from qom are thought to account for most of those so far infected in kuwait, bahrain, iraq and lebanon. covid-19 infections have now been confirmed around the globe, including isolated cases in south and central america and in africa. if the disease becomes endemic in any semicolonial countryand especially those in sub-saharan africawhere modern health care systems are generally poor or barely existent, the number of victims would skyrocket. responsibility for this loss of life would lie with the handful of imperialist powers, chiefly the u.s., that keep the underdeveloped world in destitution while pillaging its resources and labor. in the countries subjugated by imperialism, even eminently practical public health measures such as vaccines and clean water are unavailable to hundreds of millions. wealth care u.s.a. in the u.s., democratic party politicians have predictably pointed the finger at trump for this public health disaster in the making. true to form, the commander-in-chief has downplayed the threat of an epidemic here in a bid to stem the stock market slide and shore up his political standing, while tapping religious wing nut vice president mike pence to head up a coronavirus task force. republicans are hardly the only ones who make a mockery of medical science, with democrats having long pandered to the anti-vaccine quackery responsible for outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles. neither is trump unique among recent presidents to propose cuts to the centers for disease control; barack obama did so too. in the richest country in the world, millions go untreated or die every year because of medicine-for-profit. this system cannot even make certain everyone gets a flu shot, even as tens of thousands die of the disease annually. behind such human suffering stands the reality that the control of disease is as much a social question as a scientific one. for example, the vaccine for human papilloma virus (hpv), the most common sexually transmitted disease, is known to provide substantial protection against cervical cancer, which kills over 4,000 women a year. but many youth in the u.s. still do not receive it due to the prevalence of anti-vaccine mysticism and social stigma against promiscuity. four decades ago, in the early 1980s, the ruling class turned a blind eye to the aids epidemic, dismissing it as a gay disease. hiv has since killed tens of millions globally. anti-science attitudes and social backwardness combine with the material interests of the owners of the u.s. health care industry to produce deadly results for the general population. driving down costs to boost profits is the name of the game, never mind investing in excess capacity like stockpiles of medical supplies, supplementary hospital beds and sufficient medical staff. as in manufacturing industries, hospitals are stocked with supplies on a just in time basis to avoid the expense of maintaining inventories. with many of those supplies, not to mention pharmaceutical ingredients, normally made in china and factories there now shut down or focused on production for domestic needs, shortages are already being felt in the u.s. meanwhile, the hospitals are woefully understaffed. over the past decade, more than 120 hospitals, overwhelmingly in rural areas or the black and latino inner cities, have been shut down because they were unprofitable. given the dearth of hospital beds, in 2013 members of the governments hospital preparedness program proposed a health emergency policy of reverse triage, in which hospital patients would be sent home early to make room for the newly infected. in an epidemic, patients would be packed in hospital hallways, lobbies, lounges and waiting rooms. the dire state of the countrys public health system is symptomatic of the deep racial and class bias that afflicts health care in this sick capitalist society. investment in the health of the population as a whole is anemic unless the well-being of the rich and powerful is threatened or the owners of industry fear not having a sufficient number of workers fit enough to exploit. the rulers also worry about having healthy armed forces to deploy to defend their global interests. meanwhile, working people are made to shell out a fortune on health insurance, prescription drugs and hospital stays. one miami man who had developed flu-like symptoms after returning from china last month went to the hospital to find out if he had covid-19 and was hit with a $3,270 bill. medical price-gouging has driven many to ruin. the labor movement must place itself in the forefront of a fight for socialized medicine, with quality health care for all, free at the point of delivery (see for socialized medicine! expropriate the health care industry! wv no. 1170, 21 february). such a fight would take up other crucial demands, such as for unconditional, unlimited paid sick leave for everyone, as well as for union control of safety to ensure proper training and protocols in the face of new pathogens. this class-struggle perspective requires combating the policies of the trade-union officialdom, which subordinates the interests of workers to the needs of the capitalists and their political representatives, especially in the democratic party. what is posed is building a workers party committed to expropriating the health care and other industries through socialist revolutionthe only road to building a society where medical science, technological development and all the productive forces would be put to the service of all. why we defend china while on balance the response of the peoples republic of china (prc) to the coronavirus has been very impressive, it has been hampered by the privileged bureaucratic regime sitting atop the workers state. the smashing of capitalist class rule through the 1949 revolution laid the basis to establish and build a planned, socialized economy, which brought enormous gains for the workers and peasants. however, the parasitic ccp bureaucracy has from the start monopolized political power, deforming the workers state and undermining those gains. in the case of covid-19, the ccp bureaucrats initially tried to cover up the new disease, a disastrous step that severely impeded its containment. when medical professionals in wuhan attempted to sound a warning to others in their field, they were detained and reprimanded for spreading rumors. local officials passed the buck, professing that they could not share information about the virus without approval from above, i.e., from the central bureaucracy around party leader and chinese president xi jinping. one of the doctors who tried to alert others, 34-year-old ophthalmologist li wenliang, later died of the disease, triggering an outpouring of popular grief and anger. faced with public outrage and growing evidence of the severity of the disease, the ccp finally moved to contain it. chinese scientists were able to rapidly sequence the genome of the new virus and made it publicly available to researchers and health professionals throughout the world. two new hospitals, one with 1,000 beds and the other with 1,600, were constructed in less than two weeks, a remarkable achievement. more than 41,000 medical and support personnel were mobilized from all over the country, including from the peoples liberation army. with mass transit shut down in wuhan, the salaries of cab drivers needed to transport sick people, food and supplies were doubled. the production of face masks in factories all over the country was put into overdrive and the workers were paid several times their normal wage. fees have been waived for medical testing and treatment related to the disease. such measures speak to the immense advantages of a collectivized economy. it is impossible to imagine any capitalist country, marked by the relentless drive for profits, doing anything comparable. notably, vietnam, another bureaucratically deformed workers state, responded rapidly to contain a covid-19 outbreak there with a community lockdown, enhanced testing and resource reassignment. these are graphic illustrations of why authentic marxists, i.e., trotskyists, stand for the unconditional defense of china (as well as the other workers states of vietnam, cuba, north korea and laos) against imperialism and capitalist counterrevolution. this defense does not imply the slightest political support to the self-interested ccp bureaucracy, whose control over planning and the allocation of resources results in gross economic and social imbalances. the dismissal of local bureaucrats in wuhan who initially tried to cover up the new coronavirus typifies how the bureaucracy works: lower-level officials are sacrificed to allay public anger, while the top bureaucracy pretends to be infallible. such practices have become even more extreme under the xi regime, which attempts to present him as an all-knowing leader. from mao zedong to xi jinping, the ccp rulers have sown the illusion that china on its own can achieve socialisma society of all-sided material abundanceif only given sufficient time. the corollary to this dogma of socialism in one country is peaceful coexistence with the imperialist powers. this nationalist stalinist perversion of marxism is both utopian and reactionary, opposing the necessary fight for workers revolution internationally in order to accommodate imperialism. a proletarian political revolution is necessary to replace bureaucratic rule with that of elected workers and peasants councils. such a regime of workers democracy would strive to strengthen the collectivized property forms and would direct centralized planning, while promoting the fight for a world socialist order. medical advances and anti-science quackery chinas health system has greatly improved since the 2003 sars crisis. at that time, many millions were suffering from the dismantling of the iron rice bowl guarantee of basic medical care and other social security to the mass of the population. those cutbacks were part of far-reaching market reforms introduced as a bureaucratic response to economic stagnation and an attempt to use the whip of the market to spur modernization and growth. the prospect of free market misery sparked widespread resistance, including strikes, by the chinese proletariat. against this backdrop, we impressionistically endorsed the view that while china remained a workers state it is wrong to say that the planned economy persists in a letter reply headlined china, centralized planning and market socialism (wv no. 838, 10 december 2004). this position was later repeated in wv and other publications of the international communist league. a meeting of the icls international secretariat last year concluded that this assessment was false. despite the breakup of some smaller state-owned enterprises and reorganization of larger ones, as well as the growth of a private capitalist sector, china retains large parts of a (bureaucratically operated) planned economy while subjecting them to market mechanisms. this can be seen in the massive infrastructure development during the last world financial crisis and is today borne out by what china has done to rein in the coronavirus contagion, a centrally directed effort from top to bottom. some 95 percent of the population is now covered by state-funded insurance plans, and life expectancy in beijing and shanghai is higher than in new york city or washington, d.c. yet there are still great imbalances. these are mainly based on the fact that, even with all its economic advances, china remains poor overall in comparison to the advanced capitalist powers. but bureaucratic misrule compounds the problem. despite huge infrastructure expenditures since 2008, per capita spending on health care is a disgraceful 82nd in the world. in general, timely access to quality care still hinges on the ability to pay, which is no problem for wealthy businessmen and top ccp officials. those who can afford private care dont have to wait in line at overcrowded public facilities. for the masses, out-of-pocket payments normally have to cover about 30 percent of medical costs. beijing claims that the number of doctors relative to the chinese population is fairly high by international standards. but roughly half of those do not even have a bachelors degree. many were trained only at post-junior-high vocational schools. the disparity in medical training contributes to the countrys urban-rural divide in health care. most well-educated physicians are concentrated in urban hospitals, while those lacking a bachelors degree are overwhelmingly found in rural areas. furthermore, within the cities access to those well-trained doctors is unequal, with the well-to-do having the inside track. a longstanding shortage of nurses also hampers the provision of decent care. even worse, many chinese doctors continue to practice so-called traditional chinese medicine, which has no scientific merit. in this activity, they have the open support of the ccp regime. chinas national health commission has demanded that medical institutions actively promote this quackery. xi himself calls for a combination of western and traditional chinese medicinesas if science existed in regional variantsto be used in treating the coronavirus. the bureaucracys positive attitude toward traditional medicine goes back to maos peasant-based ccp in the 1930s, which reversed the partys early opposition to medical quackery (see pseudoscience, snake oil and stalinism in china, wv no. 1028, 9 august 2013). counterrevolutionaries in hong kong run amok the spread of covid-19 to the prcs capitalist hong kong enclave has again exposed the utterly reactionary nature of the pro-imperialist democracy movement there (see article page 4). waving u.s. flags and chanting, liberate hong kong, anti-china mobs have besieged sites designated for covid-19 screening, and protesters threw a molotov cocktail at an unoccupied housing project slated to become a quarantine center. using the pretext of the coronavirus, in early february thousands of medical personnel in hong kong waged a reactionary one-week strike directed against the chinese deformed workers state, demanding a full shutdown of the border with the mainland. imperialist poster boy joshua wong is among those who have demanded that w.h.o. director general tedros ghebreyesus resign due to supposed unreasonable favoritism towards china. some have even insisted that real hong kongers, i.e., not chinese from the mainland or migrant workers from elsewhere in asia, must get priority in sales of face masks to protect against infection. hong kong, which became an autonomous region of china after british colonial rule ended in 1997, remains one of the most unequal places on earth. nearly 70 percent of low-income families cannot afford to buy masks or disinfectant. under its one country, two systems policy, the ccp regime has criminally made itself directly responsible for maintaining a capitalist economy in hong kong. upholding the interests of the hong kong bourgeoisie against those they exploit and oppress is a massive betrayal of the working people there and on the chinese mainland. we say: expropriate the hong kong tycoons! u.s. imperialisms anti-china offensive chinas battle against covid-19 comes in the period of the u.s. trade/tariff war and stepped-up military provocations in the asia-pacific region. the ultimate aim, upon which democrats and republicans fully agree, is to promote counterrevolution that restores capitalist rule in china and makes it one giant sweatshop under the imperialist boot. the trade-union bureaucracy, with its america first protectionism and anti-communist china-bashing, plays right into this reactionary campaign. the bourgeois media in the u.s. has helped whip up anti-china sentiment around the coronavirus, with the wall street journal running a february 3 opinion piece titled china is the real sick man of asia, which sparked outrage in beijing. even though trump praised the xi regimes handling of the coronavirus in his february 4 state of the union address, some of the most fervid anti-china hawks in his administration have seized on the crisis to lash out at beijing. secretary of commerce wilbur ross ghoulishly told fox business news that chinas economic slowdown due to the epidemic could help to accelerate the return of jobs to the u.s. the medical emergency has indeed hit chinas economy hard, though the depth and duration of this blow cannot yet be predicted. chinas role in the world economy is vastly greater today than in 2003, with its share of global gdp rising four-fold to 16 percent. the disruption of international supply lines is reverberating worldwide. wuhan is a major manufacturing hub, especially in auto and fiber optics; one local company is the largest maker of the cables that carry data around the planet. meanwhile, industries based in the u.s. and elsewhere that sell to the vast chinese consumer market are already taking a major hit. in the name of curtailing spread of the disease, the u.s. and other countries have temporarily banned entry by chinese citizens and foreign nationals who recently visited china. the u.s. has now extended a ban to iran travel. the w.h.o., along with the chinese government, initially opposed such bans. since then, the w.h.o. has issued contradictory statements. its february 29 update, while advising against travel restrictions, also acknowledges that they may only be justified at the beginning of an outbreak. such restrictions must be based on a careful risk assessment, be proportionate to the public health risk, be short in duration, and be reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves. one reason for caution is the lack of adequate screening mechanisms, particularly for asymptomatic carriers of the virus. we are in no position to judge the public health merits of the travel bans and thus take no position for or against them. however, we recognize that the restrictions imposed by capitalist governments like those in the u.s. and australia are motivated not only by medical concerns but also by racial bigotry and national chauvinism. the u.s. has a long history of anti-asian racism, exemplified by the chinese exclusion act of 1882 and japanese american internment camps during world war ii. a century ago, asian immigrants in the u.s. and other imperialist countries were reviled for supposedly being bearers of syphilis, malaria and other diseases. today, racist abuse against people of chinese descent is on the rise. in los angeles, an asian american middle schooler was beaten up after students accused him of having the virus. asian immigrants traveling through the midwest were barred from two hotels in indiana. restaurants, shops and cafes in italy, japan and south korea posted signs denying entry to chinese people. anti-chinese racism has been particularly virulent in australia, where newspaper headlines warned of a chinese virus and ordered china kids stay home. in france, where one paper ran an editorial titled yellow peril, postings on the twitter hashtag #jenesuispasunvirus (i am not a virus) have exposed multiple instances of racist taunting in schoolyards and of subway passengers moving away from people who appear asian. helping to prepare the ground for this yellow peril racism, the fbi has for years been smearing chinese scientists, professors and students in the u.s. as potential spies for beijing. last year, the feds, together with officials at the national institutes of health, compelled a renowned cancer hospital in houston to fire three scientists allegedly with ties to china. dozens of similar investigations are said to be underway nationwide. such witchhunts are the antithesis of the international collaboration and coordination that is a wellspring of scientific advance. such world cooperation is crucial to expediently address the problems presented by infectious disease, which know no boundaries. but this need is severely impeded by the capitalist-imperialist system. capitalism has created a world market, but the domination of that market by the advanced capitalist countries produces war, massive inequality and poverty. the means of production must be torn out of the hands of the capitalist class on an international scale through a series of proletarian revolutions. this will lay the basis for an internationally planned, collectivized economy, which will unleash the productive forces to satisfy want. all aspects of human health would make a great leap, with poverty, homelessness and starvation eradicated from the earth. among the many decisions to make through considered debate will be how much to invest in supplementary public health resources in order to maximize readiness for the inevitable arrival of new pathogens. it is the purpose of the international communist league (fourth internationalist) to forge the vanguard workers parties that are necessary to lead the proletariat, at the head of all the dispossessed and oppressed, in fighting for a socialist future.

[ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/vaccinatheist/comments/fbp975/vaccination_is_it_safe/)vaccinations are considered safe if there are not any health concerns. it provides your child with protection throughout their life and will stop them from contracting diseases that could be prevented. according to the cdc, we vaccinate to protect our future. we do not vaccinate just to protect our children. we also vaccinate to protect our grandchildren and their grandchildren. with one disease, smallpox, we stopped the leak in the boat by eradicating the disease. our children do not have to get smallpox shots anymore because the disease no longer exists. smallpox is now only a memory, and if we keep vaccinating against other diseases, the same will someday be true for them too. vaccinations are one of the best ways to put an end to the serious effects of certain diseases. ### what could happen if we stop vaccinating?  ### - diseases that are almost unknown would stage a comeback. before long we would see epidemics of diseases that are nearly under control today. more children would get sick and more would die (center for disease control).  ### diseases are becoming rare due to vaccinations. ### - it is true, some diseases (like polio and diphtheria) are becoming very rare in the u.s. of course, they are becoming rare largely because we have been vaccinating against them.  ### who should not receive vaccinations?  ### - because of age, health conditions, or other factors, some people should not get certain vaccines or should wait before getting them. reference the guidelines within the centers for disease control link for each vaccine.

[","  1-the coronavirus will vanish in april.  trump has repeatedly suggested that warmer weather in april will wipe out the virus. on february 10, he said that a lot of people think that goes away in april with the heat as the heat comes in. typically, that will go away in april, and then four days later he said, theres a theory that, in april, when it gets warm historically, that has been able to kill the virus.  flu season generally ends in spring, but that does not mean coronavirus will go away. currently the virus is spreading in singapore, where weather is already warmer. and multiple public health officials, including trumps own cdc director robert redfield, have said the president is wrong. defend democracy. click to invest in courageous progressive journalism today.  2-there will be close to zero cases of coronavirus within a few days.  on february 26, the president said at a press conference that when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, thats a pretty good job weve done.  trump had no basis for saying that the number of coronavirus cases in the united states would be close to zero within a couple of days. since that statement, the number of u.s. cases has only ticked up and is now over 1,000.  3-the coronavirus is just like the flu.  at yet another news conference, trump remarked that the disease itself isnt so bad, saying, with ebola, we were talking about it before, you disintegrated. if you got ebola, that was it. [ coronavirus] is like a flu, and this is a much different situation than ebola.  while ebola is a more virulent disease, its sufferers do not disintegrate and many of them survive. more to the point, trumps own officials have warned that coronavirus is ten times more lethal than the seasonal flu.  4-the coronavirus is under control because i closed the border.  in a recent tweet, trump said, that the coronavirus started in china and spread to various countries throughout the world, but very slowly in the u.s. because president trump closed our border, and ended flights, very early.  trump has not actually done either of those things, and experts say doing so would not have helped.  5-scientists are very close to releasing a vaccine.  while on a diplomatic trip to india, trump said, i think that whole situation will start working out were very close to a vaccine. its a sentiment he has also expressed in meetings with business leaders.  but its not true. the cdc says developing a vaccine will take 12-18 months, including fully testing its safety and effectiveness.  6-anyone can get tested for coronavirus right now.  trump has also assured the public that testing for coronavirus is widely available, saying anyone who wants a test can get a test.  thats not true. there has been a critical shortage of effective testing kits and labs that can run them. even when doctors recommend tests for patients, they are stuck waiting.  7-tests arent available because of a regulation passed by president obama.  on the flip side, trump has at other points acknowledged obtaining tests is difficult, but that its president barack obamas fault. the obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what were doing, trump said last week. and we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more rapid and accurate fashion.  this is false. as one aide to sen. lamar alexander (r-tn) told the atlanta voice, the obama administration did propose expanding fda oversight of diagnostic tests, but no rule was ever drafted or took effect.  8-its all a hoax created by democrats.  perhaps the most reckless lie trump has told about coronavirus was his remark, at a recent rally, that the virus is the democrats new hoax.  even trump has since tried to walk back this claim, insisting that he doesnt consider the virus itself a hoax, but that democrats are blowing it out of proportion to hurt his campaign for re-election.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"0, news copy",93487,43,CovidVaccine

lipsitch: we know that the spread is even greater than it was then. it was likely then that it would spread more widely, but there was still hope for containment. i think now that its in more countries even singapore, which is really good at tracing cases, has found some cases that arent linked to previous known cases its clear that there are probably many cases in countries where we havent yet found them. this is really a global problem thats not going to go away in a week or two. gazette: you indicated that the rapid increase in cases was largely due to existing cases that hadnt been diagnosed rather than new infections. is that still your sense, or is some of the daily increase in cases due to new transmission? lipsitch: its clearly partly due to new transmission and it was partly due to new transmission then. separating out reporting delays from new transmission is hard, but over the last few days, it appears that the rate of increase in new cases in china has slowed relative to the exponential growth we saw before. some people are cautiously hopeful that thats due to the success of control measures rather than the inability to count many cases. i think thats possible, since the control measures have been rather extreme in some places. so, now the question is whether these control measures are working or whether were mostly seeing a saturation in their ability to test thousands of cases.  gazette: when we talk about control measures, i think the one thats most obvious to people who are following this are the quarantines. are there other things going on that are also important? lipsitch: for the cutting off of wuhan,cordon sanitaireis probably a better word for it because the movement restrictions apply to everybody, not just the exposed people. theyre not exactly quarantined. then theres the quarantine of people who are sick and may or may not have the coronavirus, along with the isolation of people who have the coronavirus. all of that may be helping. weve had some concerns based on news reports that the way theyre doing the bulk quarantine and isolation of cases could be harmful in china, but its very hard to get a clear answer on what exactly is being done. the early reports said that they were taking people who were confirmed corona cases and putting them together in mass quarters with people who were not confirmed as corona but might have a fever or respiratory symptoms. if that was true, that could spread the virus further. since then, ive heard a number of times that thats not actually true. so i dont know what to think of that. it doesnt seem like the sort of thing a responsible public health agency would do.  gazette: has it become apparent that the virus is either easier to transmit or more deadly than previously thought? or are these increasing case and fatality numbers in line with what our thinking was a week ago? lipsitch: the ease of transmission is still being confirmed. in terms of the so-called r-nought, or how many secondary cases a single case infects, experts assessment is getting tighter around a level of transmissibility thats perhaps lower than sars, which was about 3 and higher than pandemic flu, which can be up to about 2. but what makes this one perhaps harder to control than sars is that it may be possible to transmit before you are sick, or before you are very sick so its hard to block transmission by just isolating confirmed cases.  gazette: is that the most concerning new information, that it might be transmissible before symptoms are apparent? that would seem to make this a lot trickier. lipsitch: yes. i think thats the most concerning piece, but the evidence for that so far in the public domain is pretty limited. ive seen hints that arent published yet, but the evidence for that thats been peer reviewed is quite limited. on severity, estimates are that its worse than seasonal flu, where about one in 1,000 infected cases die, and its not as bad as sars, where 8 or 9 percent of infected cases died. ive been working with some colleagues on estimates. theyre preliminary still but bounded by those two. thats a large range, however, so the important question is where the final figure ends up, because 3 or 4 percent of cases dying would be much more worrisome than 0.4 percent.  ##theres likely to be a period of widespread transmission in the u.s., and i hope we will avert the kind of chaos that some other places are seeing.  gazette: is it significant that there are so few cases internationally compared with the number in china? is that an indication that control measures are working or is it just gathering steam internationally? lipsitch: unfortunately, i think its more likely to be that its gathering steam. weve released a preprint that weve been discussing publicly and trying to get peer reviewed in the meantime that looks at the numbers internationally, based on how many cases you would expect from normal travel volumes. and a couple of things are striking. one is that there are countries that really should be finding cases and havent yet, like indonesia and maybe cambodia. they are outside the range of uncertainty you would expect even given variability between countries. so our best guess is that there are undetected cases in those countries. indonesia said a couple of days ago that it had done 50 tests, but it has a lot of air travel with wuhan, let alone the rest of china. so 50 tests is not enough to be confident youre catching all the cases. thats one bit of evidence that to me was really striking. second, i was reading the wall street journal that singapore had three cases so far that were not traced to any other case. singapore is the opposite of indonesia, in that they have more cases than you would expect based on their travel volume, probably because theyre better at detection. and even they are finding cases that they dont have a source for. that makes me think that many other places do as well. of course, were making guesses from limited information, buti think theyre pretty likely to be correct guesses, given the totality of information  gazette: but what is most important for the public to know about this? lipsitch: theres likely to be a period of widespread transmission in the u.s., and i hope we will avert the kind of chaos that some other places are seeing. thats likely if we continue to be prepared, but i think its going to be a new virus that we have to deal with. that wont be because the united states government has failed to contain it, it will mean that this is an uncontainable virus. if were dealing with it, its because everybodys going to be dealing with it. i think thats a likely scenario.  gazette: from a treatment standpoint, it seems there are a lot of mild cases and then fewer serious cases that need respiratory support. should hospitals and the medical establishment start thinking about capacity-building now? lipsitch: to the extent thats possible, yes, but i dont know how flexible that capacity is. i think we should be prepared for the equivalent of a very, very bad flu season, or maybe the worst-ever flu season in modern times, since weve had ventilators and been able to provide intensive respiratory support. and it might not be real flu season because the annual flu season is already passing. one question ive gotten a lot is whether it will go away in warmer weather, like sars did. im not at all convinced that sars went away because of the warmer weather. i think it went away because people got it under control in may and june. but there is some evidence and were working on quantifying it that coronaviruses do transmit less efficiently in the warmer weather. so its possible that we will get some help from that, but i dont think that will solve the problem, as evidenced by the fact that theres transmission in singapore, on the equator.  gazette: once people get this and recover, do we know whether they will have immunity? lipsitch: that is a very important question, but we dont know the answer yet because its been too short a time. the evidence from other coronaviruses is that there is some immunity but it doesnt last for long. immunity to the seasonal coronaviruses lasts for maybe a couple of years, and then you can get reinfected. theres a further question of whether thats because the virus is changing or because your immunity is not very durable. given that its a new virus, we cant say anything with certainty, but it would be reasonable to expect immunity to be somewhat short-lived, meaning a couple of years, rather than lifelong.  gazette: so without a vaccine, you may have a respite for a year or two but then you may get it again? lipsitch: yes, and that is a bit like the flu, although typically people get the flu every five or six years.",1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,69,44,CovidVaccine

""this is what we were set up for,"" says jos rietveld, director of ggd groningen, on the phone. his region is one of the few in the netherlands where efforts are still being made to trace all contacts of a patient - possibly thanks to the limited number of known infections in the north. normally there are four doctors and four nurses working in the infectious diseases department. "" that's now temporarily expanded to a hundred men."" thanks to internal shifts, the groningen supplemental work can be done: school doctors have nothing to do, youth nurses have time left over and the travel vaccinations have come to a complete standstill. according to rietveld, it's in the dna of the ggd. "" we're set up to scale up quickly in the event of crises."" for tracing, you mainly need hands. it's intensive, but this is not rocket science. but in most regions in the netherlands, 25 in total, contact tracing has been put on the back burner. it is very labour-intensive. just the conversation to inform a patient about his infection quickly takes two hours. what does this mean for me? am i going to die now? as a ggd, you can't just step over that before you can find out who the infected person has had contact with. then all those contacts have to be traced and warned. and people who hear that they have been in contact with a patient often also have all sorts of fears and questions. then you as a ggd have to keep an eye on all those people, make an inventory of complaints and test for the virus in the meantime. that is the ideal picture. and that will only be possible with a lot of manpower. or a brilliant app. "" where's the urgency? arnold bosman, international expert in infectious disease control, among other things as an advisor to the world health organization, does not understand why so little attention is paid to this major task facing the ggd. "" where is the urgency? i don't see it."" bosman says that icus rightly received a lot of attention in the beginning. diederik gommers became the figurehead of the intensive cares, where he is chairman of the professional association. "" he did a great job. he convinced everyone of the seriousness of the situation. now we are actually missing a gommers-like person. because we need to get back to source and contact research. the icu's were the mops, but the ggd's are now hand on faucet."" according to bosman, the current approach ""is not enough to master the virus. that's the only way out."" field epidemiologist amrish baidjoe also lacks the classical craftsmanship in the dutch approach. as an assistant professor at the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine, he has a lot of experience with infectious disease control in vulnerable environments such as refugee camps. "" are we looking abroad at all? are we willing to learn from developing countries? for tracing, you mainly need hands. it's intensive, but this isn't rocket science."" 	 	 christian hoebe, professor of infectious disease control, states that behind the scenes there are discussions on how the ggd should prepare for the next step. he is attached to ggd zuid-limburg as doctor and head of infectious disease control. contact research he calls an important building block. "" but it also depends on the app. what does the minister expect from us?"" at the start of the outbreak, they quickly called on medical students in maastricht to help them find contacts. but when the numbers grew rapidly, they switched to 'contact research light'. we'll give every infected person a letter telling them what to do, like stay home with the family. we leave it up to the person to inform others. it's a passive form of contact inquiry."" he points out that in the southern regions, gmds have been expanded by a factor of eight to ten for work on corona.  germany tests more yet the contrast with a few kilometres away in germany is impressive. since the beginning of the crisis, the virus has been hunted much more intensively there. the germans are testing more, tracing more sources and more actively searching for contacts. relatively speaking, there are considerably fewer deaths in germany, but no one dares to say whether this is due to the approach taken.  now the next phase has arrived, said health minister jens spahn this week. he presented a ten-step plan to continue to break the infection chain. soon the number of infected will grow again, he predicted. so more clout is needed at the german ggd's: for every 20,000 inhabitants there should be teams of five detectives. for contact research alone, that means mobilizing more than 20,000 people. the army has offered its help.  the netherlands doesn't want it. at least, there is no debate about it. in the united states there is a debate as to whether 100,000 or 300,000 extra people are needed for contact research. the focus here is on the apps, which should enable better and more effective contact research. "" that is the reason for these apps,"" said minister hugo de jonge (public health, cda) in the lower house last week. "" the purpose of these apps is to restore the ggd's source and contact research to its former glory. without those applications there would have to be ""hundreds and hundreds of people"", de jonge said.  why is that considered such a big problem? the netherlands so deliberately deviates from the home garden and kitchen approach of infectious disease control. "" contact detection is essential in the covid-19 approach,"" says the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc), an important eu body.  ""even if you have an app tomorrow, it will not solve your capacity problem with source and contact research,"" warns bosman. field epidemiologist baidjoe emphasises the importance of social interaction in this type of research. "" involve the community. people who hear that they are infected can also feel guilty. have i been too laconic? you don't tell that through an app, this is people's work.""  ggd makes plans sjaak de gouw, as portfolio holder for infectious diseases at the ggd the liaison between the national crisis team and the regional ggds, calls the expansion capacity of the dutch ggds 'endless', whether with temporary workers, students or call centres. the red cross has also offered help, says de gouw.  ""we have received a request from the cabinet to prepare for upscaling. but we don't know when that will be and with how many people. we are making plans for that."" the rivm is already ready for this: director of the centre for infectious disease control jaap van dissel told the house on wednesday that as far as he is concerned, the ggd urgently needs to restart the contact investigation.  however, there are still doubts. de gouw disputes that the ggd plays a crucial role and he is not convinced of the german approach. "" what is the rationale behind the strategy of many tests? it doesn't prevent infections.""  in parliament this week, de gouw gave a presentation in which ""very extensive"" contact research is announced in the future phase of ""the new normal"" in which apps take over part of the handiwork. at the same time he does not show himself to be a big fan of intensive contact research, despite the explicit advice of the world health organization and the ecdc.

unequivocally yes. the efforts of so many first responders and health professionals, and the public, saved those who might have otherwise died. but success is relative. that even careful preparations could still leave some people dead and others badly harmed is both a fact of life and appalling to accept. a threat as dire as the new coronavirus exposes the weaknesses in our society and our politics. if americans could seek testing and care without worrying about co-pays or surprise bills, and if everyone who showed symptoms had paid sick leave, the united states could more easily slow the spread of covid-19. but a crisis finds a nation as it is, not as its citizens wish it to be. the coronavirusand the measures enacted to stop itcould quickly change the rhythms of americans daily lives. the united states is seeing its first deaths, first emergency declarations, first school closings, first mandatory work-at-home policies. if the number of covid-19 cases spikes quickly, hospitals could soon be deluged with patients seeking care. this is a predictable consequence of any epidemic, but few americans personal experience gives them any reason to understand how disruptive these changes could be if the epidemic continues to worsen. ironically, the officials now urging citizens to keep calm understand far more acutely than the general public how much else can go wrong. a municipal police chief in the boston area recently urged me to imagine that a school district closed for even three weeks. take just one child, raised by a single parent who is a police officer. the child is home, so the parent must stay home. other officers in the same patrol will be affected even if they dont have kids in school. shifts will change, nonessential functions will be put off, and the department will have less flexibility to respond to problems unrelated to the epidemiceven as, with more teens unsupervised, rates of car accidents and certain crimes could well increase. emergency-response officials are hesitant to play out these dangers in public. this police chief asked me not to identify him because, like so many others in positions of responsibility, he worries that misgivings like his will become self-fulfilling propheciesthat citizens will panic if their local authorities give voice to their own doubts. meanwhile, president donald trump and his administration have vacillated between ignoring the threat and making wildly unrealistic promises about it. on wednesday, vice president mike pence promised 1.5 million coronavirus tests, but the atlantic reported friday that, according to all available evidence, fewer than 2,000 had been conducted in the united states. trump himself is simply lying about basic facts about the covid-19 response; despite the testing kit shortfall, he has publicly stated that everyone who wants to get tested can get tested. chinas aggressive containment of the new virus in the early weeks of this year gave other nations time to ready themselves for what was inevitably going to come: a shortage of test kits and personal protective equipment for a virus that spreads as quickly and causes as many deaths and hospitalizations as covid-19 does. the united states wasted that opportunity. trumps initial impulse to downplay the risk, at least until the stock market took note, wasnt just fanciful; it was dangerous. he has consistently minimized the number of sick, blamed barack obamas administration for a shortage of test kits, and publicly mused about the potential of a vaccine being found quickly. the american response to the new disease should be based on something more than hunches and magical thinking. the whole time, people like me have been dutifully advising friends, family, and everyone else to take prudent precautions and avoid panicking. thats still good advice, because any measures that slow the spread of the disease and lower the death rate could save thousands of lives. but americans should also understand that even the best preparation humanly possibly wouldnt be perfectand that what the united states has done so far falls far short of that. especially at this point, even a more vigorous response will not preclude a lot of people from getting sick. preventing all infections is no longer a possibility, and the measure of success is how much public-health authorities can reduce the number of people who die or fall seriously ill. --juliette kayyem, a former assistant secretary for homeland security under president obama, is the faculty chair of the homeland security program at harvards kennedy school of government. she is the author of security mom: an unclassified guide to protecting our homeland and your home.--",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"1, news copy (only from comment context, else I would have more difficulties)",92437,33,CovidVaccine

[ https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html) to add insult to injury, amc had already announced another 200 million shares in a public stock offering that morning to raise money, with their ceo going on to threaten investors that amc will go bankrupt without help. this probably isnt the first time youve heard of a possible amc bankruptcy either, especially if youre a subscriber to this very subreddit. [ https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/) and here is where im gonna start throwing some numbers at you. because as awful as it is to threaten investors with the fear of bankruptcy, the reality is that amc is in serious financial trouble. pulled from td ameritrade, heres a few numbers for you from their balance sheet (as of their earnings in q3 2020): assets: cash/cash equivalents: $506 million total current assets: $609 million prop./plant/equip, net: $6,808 million total assets: $10,876 million liabilities: current accounts payable/accrued expenses: $1,057 million total current liabilities: $1,588 million total debt: $5,919 million total liabilities: $13,246 million so i know what youre thinking: tldr, stop numbers give positions retard. and ill get there, just like george r.r. martin is getting to the end of the game of thrones series. but what is really important to see here is that for the current period that ends in one year, amc has a deficit of $979 million ($1,588 million in current liabilities minus $609 million in current assets). and normally, when in such a situation, you generally have three solutions: go offer more stock; go sell some of your company; or, you take out loans with a creditor. amc is doing the former with a stock offering. but why not go to a creditor and get a loan? well, maybe its because ytd for q1, q2, and q3, amc has already drawn down a shit town of debt out just to cover their ass. creditors likely will not be willing to finance this sinking ship much longer and amc are in legitimate trouble. [ https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html) so this brings me to cinemark and their balance sheet. and its here ill give you a few more numbers from their q3 2020 balance sheet: assets: cash/equivalents: $826 million total current assets: $984 million prop./plant/equip, net: $2,832 million total assets: $5,803 million liabilities: accounts payable/accrued expenses: $599 million total current liabilities: $624 million total debt: $2,519 million total liabilities: $4,796 million so id like to immediately draw your attention to the current period for cnk. due to their stronger cash position (which in fairness, has been due to financing this year as well), they have a net surplus of $360 million for the next 12 months. whats more, they can cover all of their current liabilities with their cash position alone for the next year. this is to say that if you believe that the covid will be behind us within a year and that movie theaters will at least by open back to full capacity, cinemark has the financial strength to survive another year without any sales. the next thing id like to bring to your attention is the size of both companies. if you look at the prop./plant/equipment for amc and cnk, youll see that amc has $6,808 million in assets cnk has $2,832 million in assets amc is the largest movie theater company in the world, and here, it shows. they are over twice the size of cinemark in property alone, and their total assets are just over twice the value of cinemarks as well. so amc does have quite a bit of market share on the movie theater industry. however, with amcs financial weakness and a looming threat of bankruptcy, here are some possible outcomes: 1. amc goes bankrupt. they will have to reorganize their corporate structure and will likely lose some of their theaters along the way. competitors may have the option to buy some of these theaters and amc loses some of their market share which could be beneficial for cnk. 2. amc looks to merge. this is true for the larger market as a whole, but with belabored businesses that are on the verge of bankruptcy, mergers and acquisitions look to be a huge market in the upcoming year. and while cinemark doesnt have the financial strength, on paper, to take on the massive debts the amc currently holds, there is something to consider here in the numbers. if amc is twice the size of cinemark, cinemarks market share would increase by 3x on an outright acquisition of amc (and thats assuming they took on their debts as they stand today). cinemark would more than double their debt in doing so, but cnk has also shown that they can manage their book better. they may see the added market share as a warrantable risk to take on. 3. amc gets the funding it needs and survives in the short term. cinemark isnt really affected by this outcome. next, lets consider the technicals of cinemark. cinemark was trading just above $30 before the great stock market fall back in march. it was trading as low as $5.71 at its lowest, and outside a one month period from the end of september to november 9th(vaccine news day), cnk was trading in a price channel that bottomed out around $10. with positive vaccine news and a rollout of vaccinations, it is likely that cnk will be able to open its doors again in the next six months. as such, there is a case to be made for cnk not breaking a fairly strong level of support moving forward. the last part, admittedly, is a bit of my own opinion. but since the election and pfizer/modernas vaccine news, there has been a large shift in money across the markets. specifically, money in the nasdaq (covid-proof) tech sector moved outwards towards other sectors, including stocks that were rightfully battered due to covid. retail, energy, and entertainment all saw large boosts with covid relief. you dont have to look much farther than stocks like kohls (kss), nordstrom (jwn), marathon petroleum (mpc), airlines (any of them), or cruise lines, all while watching tech largely stagnate (except for beloved meme stocks like tesla and amd, of course). many of these are still trading below their pre-covid highs, and it is where i personally believe large, institutional money is moving and holding large portions of money. sure, covid cases are spiking at the moment and there is an argument to be made for the nasdaq taking up arms again. but the stock market is a forward looking instrument and is now looking ahead to a point in time when covid has been dealt with. so to bring this all full circle, here is my tldr for why cinemark is a stock you should seriously consider looking into: 1. it has the financial strength to survive for at least another year, well past the point of covid vaccinations and a return to normalcy. 2. with amc on the ropes, cnk could stand to benefit from an increase in market share if amc does file bankruptcy. they could even pick up existing amc theaters for significantly cheaper if such a corporate amc structure were to occur. 3. while still trading below its pre-covid highs (and for veritable reason), vaccine news and actual vaccinations only stand to help stocks in the entertainment sector (barring a failed vaccine, of course). and while covid cases are certainly rising in the short term, because cnk has the financial backing to weather another year, it is a short term headwind that will likely be overtaken when vaccinations ramp up. positions? tldr? give yourself a year on this one. buy a leap and leave it for a while. if you hate getting cucked by theta decay, maybe sell some 10 or 12.5 strike otm puts. that way, if you end up getting put shares, its of a stock you wanted long term anyway (and you got paid to get put into it). premiums for such a volatile industry and very high right now and there is good money to be made in theta and vega. cnk 15 jan 2022 20 bought call: 4.00 (as of this writing) cnk 19 march 2021 12.5 sold put: 2.40 (as of this writing). with a breakeven of 10.10, this puts you just above support if you do get put. if cinemark is trading above $12.50 in 3 months time, this is a 19.2% roi (or 6.4% a month), which is still a hell of a return (especially if you believe in the stock long term, like i do). disclaimer: i am not a financial advisor, fiduciary, analyst, nor do i hold any position in a financial company. investing (and on wsb, gambling) comes with inherent risks and it is

116,"but you can confidently say they would have worn masks if masks were effective at preventing disease, when we know they pooped in their drinking water?"," yes, you've said this, but you haven't provided any actual argument or evidence for it. on the scale of civilizations or evolution, the ~400 years since obstetrical forceps were invented is nothing; one could easily have used your argument a few centuries. something else that wikipedia mentions--they may have existed in the 1600s, but didn't become popular until much later. a good idea does not necessarily become popular, and it may be rarely invented. again, with forceps, the effect size is large and obvious. and our ancestors eventually noticed. masks are easier to manufacture and use than forceps, and our ancestors didn't notice a large effect size. yes it is possible to miss really low hanging fruit, but anything hanging this low absolutely has to be scrutinized. because it probably isn't actually fruit if it has hung this low for so long.  i don't think i fudged your words; this claim is just wrong. there are rcts that demonstrate surgical masks prevent infection of airborne flu-like viruses. yes this is the time that i ask you for those studies lol. because i've had this argument several times before and it's turned up empty. and again, fudging my words, but the studies also need confirmed infection as an endpoint. i don't care if surgical masks appear to reduce the density of 2:1 glycerin droplets under 251nm flourescent light.  ""they're low-tech"" is not correct in any meaningful sense. please stop repeating the same talking points i've debunked 3 or 4 times, it's rather tiring. i think you're really drawing this out by not consistently distinguishing between cloth masks and surgical masks. i've already overwhelmingly agreed that history has not tested surgical masks. you don't have much to say about cloth masks  what if airborne pandemics weren't common in the past? surely pre-vaccine, influenza and other respiratory viruses were more common and more deadly. [ here's](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/ph/ph709_influenza/us-mortality-rates-from-various-diseases-1900-1965.jpg) a chart going back to the 1900s showing basically double the level of yearly deaths from influenza compared to covid. so ""life as normal"" in the past had twice as much influenza death than a 2020 ""pandemic"".

but why should the person who asks that question be ridiculed? shouldn't we just be transparent and say it's because of the r rate, the rate of infection and therefore the chance of death. because even one percent of the population in america, is 3,000,000 deaths. sadly we also know that there are people who fall outside of the elderly and underlying conditions group who are badly affected. fortunately or unfortunately depending on your perspective, they seem to be the exception and not the rule. but it is still one of those blunt things, everyone at some point, must face that reality, that death will come, and we cannot save and protect everybody. no matter how much we try. i know the answer is, ""if we save one life"", but how much should that one life cost? and if one life is worth it, then why don't we look at helping other people who face death through preventable disease? the british government is shifting from pillar to post, one day they're encouraging you to go to the pub and not meet friends or families even in their garden. then they're saying that we can meet people in the gardens, but not in the home. then they say that we can't meet anybody anywhere except for the pub and they plucked ""six"" out of thin air for how many people you're allowed to meet. then they decided actually it's the pubs that's causing the problem and not saying where this damn virus is spreading. they've just taken a sledgehammer to it and it comes across like they simply don't know what's going on. which i think is probably closer to the point. we can see the deaths and the infections rising, but apart from closing things down, they don't know how to deal with it. they don't seem to be any further forward than they were six months ago. and the period in which everybody was going to the pub, deaths and infections were at such a tiny rate to be virtually undetectable in the graphs. only for then schools to return in around september/october and the rates to start going up. one day we hear that just because you've had covid before, doesn't mean you won't get it again and won't have antibodies. but what's the point of a vaccine if you don't retain your immunity? are we going to be having rolling three monthly vaccines? or does the vaccine immunity last longer than an actual covid infection? and if we don't close borders, with a limited immunity, how do we ensure that any risk is quarantined?

was it referred to by that name court? i always thought it was a myth|yes, daisy's destruction is real, it was referred to by name in court and the judge had to watch the 12 minutes of it that were hosted on hurt2thecore. |the ""myth"" part is that it shows a murder. the toddler, daisy, lived, though she suffered such horrific injuries she will never be able to bear children. hopefully she was young enough that she will grow up without the memory. |however, scully did murder at least one child, whose body was found under the floorboards of his house. it is not known whether he filmed her murder as no video evidence of it has come to light. ^(the below is a reply to the above)| thanks for answering. i actually watched a really good video on hurt2thecore on youtube once, i think it was by a guy called nexpo. it was really detailed and informative about the whole case - i forgot those details. thanks again for replying, this ama is really informative!|i think i recall that one, it was from a few years ago. |an excellent podcast that came out recently is ""hunting warhead"", highly recommend a listen. it is a tough listen, but exceptionally well-told and respectfully handled how do you detach yourself from your work? i'm an investigator for a law firm and i've had a lot of difficult working on wrongful death cases recently. also, how did you first end up getting published? any tips for people interested in that field? thanks!|i don't detach. when i was researching hurtcore, it was harrowing and affected me deeply. writing that part of the book was a very slow process because i just couldn't be in that headspace for very long at a time. once the book was written i didn't go back there. |i already had a reputation as a blogger and a freelance journalist when i pitched my book on silk road. i got an agent and it was auctioned off, with pan macmillan getting the rights. at the time, silk road was still going strong, and the book i wrote was about this new frontier of drug dealing that was changing the world. i was writing it ""from the inside"" as i had been an active part of the community for two years. however, right as i submitted the final manuscript to my publisher, silk road was busted and ross ulbricht arrested, so i had to quickly change the narrative to a ""rise and fall"" thing! how many times have you approached law enforcement with information and how many times has the approach resulted in action? and... are there times where you know something nefarious is happening but history and the evidence at hand tells you it's not worth the effort?|there is no point in approaching law enforcement to say ""i have come across this site"". if i've found it, you can guarantee law enforcement has found it as well. |the only time i've approached law enforcement was when i had information that they did not, which was when a friendly hacker provided me with a back door into the besa mafia murder-for-hire site. i got to see all the messages and orders etc. of course le knew about the site, but they did not have the details of the people who had hits taken out on them. we tried desperately to tell police in several countries that real people had paid real money to have other real people killed, but they just weren't interested. we sounded like crazy people talking about dark web hitmen, who were scams anyway and nobody was dead, so why should they be interested? they became much more engaged when one of the people we had previously told them about later turned up dead ^(the below is a reply to the above)| by law enforcement, do you mean only local or else the big agencies? i feel like i wouldn't tell my local police department because they wouldn't really know what to do. it would have to the the bigger agencies.|fbi in us. nca in uk. afp in australia. nobody was very interested, although the fbi did visit at least one of the targets to let her know she was a target. she still wound up dead what are some of the most prevalent uses of the dark web that aren't all shady and nefarious?|we might be getting into semantics here, but people use tor, which is the most possible darknet that is used to access the dark web, just for private browsing and ensuring that commercial interests aren't following them everywhere to bombard them with ads for some thing they looked up. |some of the news organizations have a dark web presence so that whistleblowers can upload information safely. even the cia has a site on the dark web so that people can anonymously tip off matters of national security. |other than that, there are just forums, where you don't have to worry that every single stupid thing you post will be saved in posterity forever, to be trotted out years later when you run for congress or something after everything you've seen, does anything surprise you anymore or are you just numb to it at this point? do you think there should be more education/exposure about the dark web than there is now or would that just be counter-productive as people would just find another place to hide? i'm curious to hear any favourite stories about the psychonauts.|i am not numb and i hope i never become numb. i really don't visit the horrible dark places very often, unless i'm researching something specific, and even then i don't look at pictures or videos. most of the crime is pretty benign - i'm not fazed by people wanting a safer way to buy drugs. |i think there needs to be ongoing discussions about online activity and its misuse in general, but most crime still happens on the clearnet. the dark web is not nearly as large or prevalent as people fear. |for a long time, a dealer provided free lsd to anyone who wanted it for personal use (ie not sale) and to any organizations who were doing psychedelic therapy. |one psychonaut got busted and spent time in prison... only he still had bitcoin in a wallet and by the time he was released he was a millionaire. he would have just spent it on drugs otherwise :) i know law enforcement has to delve into the predator side of the dark web. with what you've seen do you think it should be mandatory or an industry standard that law enforcement officials seek professional help? i couldn't imagine investigating that daily and not thinking less of humanity at some point.|i'm pretty sure they do. i worked for legal aid for a while, and i know there were pretty strict rules in place for the lawyers who had to defend child abusers. |when i was at the trial for lux, owner of hurt2thecore, i met a cop whose job it was to watch all the videos and befriend the predators in an attempt to get them to slip up and reveal something of themselves. she said she had a little filing cabinet in her brain where she put all that stuff, and that making an arrest made it all worthwhile. she had made several arrests personally. she was a sex offender's worst nightmare :) whats one of your personal favorite investigations and what made it unique for you?|by far the besa mafia murder-for-hire case. what made it unique was that, first, i was provided a back door into the besa mafia site by a friendly hacker, so i had information that nobody else had. but then i became ""friends"" for want of a better word with the owner of the site, yura. besa mafia, of course, was not killing anyone, but yura made a lot of money scamming would-be murderers out of their money. we entered into a weird relationship over the years where i would report on his activities and he would try every trick under the sun to stop me from doing so, so that he could keep scamming people. he even offered me a job, helping him, because he had become so busy. he also provided me with names and details of people who had hits taken out on them so i could pass them on to law enforcement. |it all became horribly real when one of the people who had a hit put out of them wound up dead. it wasn't yura of course, but the guy had paid him $13k before giving up on the site and doing it himself. the thing was we had told the fbi about the hit and the $13k and they visited the victim, but then put it into the too-hard basket when she couldn't think who might have paid that much to kill her. ^(the below is a reply to the above)| wow. thats actually pretty cool. reminds me of an old saying. keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.|it's a seriously bizarre relationship. when i was hired as a consultant by cbs for a 48 hours expose on dark web hitmen, he actually agreed to meet me in london. but he thought that cbs was going to advertise his site as the real deal and he got excited and sent them details of two people who had hits put out on them. cbs sent them straight to the police and very shortly after two arrests were made and it was all over the news, where they called his site a scam. yura got so pissed about it, he never turned up to our meeting. they had even hired an academy award-nominated master of disguise makeup artist to disguise him! are ""red rooms"" actually a prevalent thing, or just a widespread misconception or rumor? i ask in part because it's very easy to see, for instance, mexican cartels dismembering people alive, etc, just on the clearnet. hell, a couple days ago i saw a video posted of a cartel member cutting out a dude's heart while the guy was alive, and he ate it. he fucking ate it. so it seems plausible...|the most popular myth of all is red rooms, where people usually women are tortured to death live on camera while those who have paid to watch type in torture commands in a chat box. think the movie hostel, with webcams. in this sense these have never been proven to exist. i get where you are coming from with the cartels, and the recent news item where they found those shipping containers set up with torture rooms freaked me out and made me wonder! |there is some truth to this rumour, but the execution is not like you see in the movies. most notably, because it involves children, not adults abused on demand for paying pedophiles, but not to the point of death ^(the below is a reply to the above)| the news about those shipping containers really made me speculate, since for every one person who gets caught doing something evil, there must be at least several more people who are very honed in their 'profession' doing the same evil deeds and worse, yet who evade being captured for decades. anyway, based on morbid things i've seen, karma comes around eventually...|i know, right? it really freaked me out, and then when i read that they already had intended victims for them but the police got to them first and put them in protected custody.. imagine seeing those pictures and knowing you were supposed to be in them!! i would retire to a deserted island somewhere ^(the below is a reply to the above)| your line of work could easily result in something like c-ptsd down the road a little ways. i have a morbid curiosity, and have seen worse than those shipping containers had to offer. i'm sure you have as well. so one more question from you, if you don't mind: what are some proactive approaches to mental health you take to safeguard your sanity?|a lot of wine. cuddle my dog hi, there! this has been fascinating to read; thank you so much for sharing! i'm curious: why do you think so many people who don't want to engage with disgusting and illegal content like hurtcore find it so interesting to read about? do you have any insight into your readership and the ethics associated with reading about these kind of topics?|i think morbid fascination with the dark is exceedingly common - just look at how many people can't get enough about serial killers! in some ways it is probably a self-defense mechanism - the vast majority of true-crime readers are women. people like to be armed with knowledge. we also like to be spooked and scared. |as for my books, i don't really go into much gory detail, but the horror still shines through out of all 9-5 jobs out there, why this? whats your motive?|i got disenchanted by being a lawyer and i had wanted to be an author since childhood. the lawyering put me in a strong enough financial position that i could quit to do a uni course for a couple of years. my plan was to become a best-selling novelist, but my first chick-lit novel was nothing special. however, during the course, i found i did really well at journalism and was soon making a living as a freelance journo before i finished the course. my first major feature was on the silk road drugs market, which i had discovered thanks to a friend who was using it. once i got in there i became fascinated by everything about it and started contacting the owner, users, vendors etc asking for stories (i was upfront about who i was). i began the first serious dark web blog - allthingsvice.com - and also became the go-to freelancer for australian dark web stories. then i pitched my first book and got a healthy advance for it. |i like working for myself, working from home and delving into things. right now i have my dream job (though it wouldn't hurt to pay a bit more. i'm certainly not making anywhere near what i used to make lawyering, but i make enough to get by and i live pretty simply) did you ever do any writing on brian farrell and his role in silk road 2.0? i was brian's cellmate for all of 2017 at sheridan federal prison and heard all of his crazy stories. was just curious as to the validity of them all.|doctorclu! i did write briefly about him in silk road, but it wasn't all positive. i remember being frustrated by the shitshow that was silk road 2.0 in the beginning, right after sr1 shut and when dpr2 took off and defcon got all dramatic. it settled down after a bit and lasted a year, when it was revealed they had a fucking undercover homeland security officer on staff the whole time. but yeah, anyhow, they are probably true. i'd love to hear them :) was there ever something on the dark web that made you surprised ( in a good way) and smile ? |so many things. back in the day of the original silk road, i became obsessed with the forums, the people behind it, the intelligent discourse about the war on drugs and philosophy. i found it amusing that drug dealers ran sales and giveaways. there were book clubs and movie clubs. |one of the most important people from that era was dr fernando cauevilla, who became a member of silk road as ""doctorx"". he was a real doctor who provided genuine, free, non-judgmental advice about drug use to the members of the site. it was quite an amazing time. ^(the below is a reply to the above)| did ulbricht get taken down the way we were told in the news? what happened to all the bitcoins?|his arrest went down the way we were told in the news. how they located the server has never been disclosed (other than a fanciful explanation that nobody could believe). this explanation may be tested if variety jones runs a fourth amendment argument at his trial |the bitcoin in the wallet on ross' computer was auctioned off by the feds. he may have other bitcoin wallets stashed somewhere but nobody knows ^(the below is another reply to the original answer)| book/movie clubs on the silk road?|yeah, they would set reading and then everyone would come back and discuss the book, or they would have a time when everyone watched the same movie at the same time and chatted about it in real time ^(the below is a reply to the above)| haha that's amazing! i don't suppose you remember any of the books in question?|they used to be a lot of philosophy books, especially on agorism. a lodging of wayfaring men was one of the books. i remember v for vendetta on a movie night you don't seem to be pushing your most recent project and you're actually answering all the questions people ask, so i've got ask...are you some sort of government plant meant to destabilize reddit? this isn't how amas are supposed to work. you come in, you half ass a few questions, hawk whatever you're here to hawk, and then leave after 20 minutes. that's how it's done.|lol i'm a genuine redditor from way back, and i love talking about the stuff i do. i did find that after i answered a question in an askreddit thread a while back that blew up, the sales followed. but that was organic and i don't think you can force it to happen - reddit can spot that a mile awy what are some of the best things about the dark web? and can anyone get on it? things you can buy that you cant buy normally online?|i really enjoy some of the forums, especially the psychonaut forums where people who like to trip on psychedelics get together and talk drugs and philosophy. there's a real ""be kind to one another"" vibe. |getting on the dark web is easy, but not getting scammed when buying things takes a lot of homework. yes, you can buy most things, but the most popular things are drugs and digital goods, i.e. things that depend on repeat custom and are easily transferable from seller to buyer ^(the below is a reply to the question)| [deleted]|you're doing the good work my man. i'd give you one of those awards if i knew how what would you define the word ""safe"" when it come to the internet (both www and dark web) world and are there any tips that i should follow to keep myself safe?|it really depends on what you mean by safe. tor, which is the darknet that provides access to the dark web will keep you safe from prying eyes and surveillance. |if you mean keep your information safe, the old-fashioned advice is to never reuse your password and to enable 2-factor authentication wherever you can. your information is quite likely somewhere on the dark web thanks to high-profile hacks of major organizations, but provided you don't re-use usernames and passwords, you really don't have to worry too much about it. |if you mean keeping yourself and/or any kid safe from predators, the only thing is to ensure you are educated about the approaches and methods they use. has covid affected the dark web in any real way? also i just read through all of the post comments, what incredible storys. i would totally buy a book about the silk road or yaru!|re covid on the dark web, here's some notes i made for an interview i did recently: | when trump first hyped hydroxychloroquine as a potential miracle cure for covid-19, drug dealers on the dark web seized on the claim. | listings quickly popped up on the most popular darknet markets | a vendor on whitehouse market sells 100 pills for $90, calling it a miracle drug for coronavirus and suggesting buyers purchase in bulk to sell at a mark-up locally. | another makes the dubious claim this drug will help people to beat corona virus there are 11 listings on empire market currently, although more than half are from the one seller, who is a well-known and trusted vendor on the site. | there were also people claiming to be selling infected blood or plasma of recovered covid victims | the infected blood stuff is just bullshit imo just because something is listed doesnt mean it is genuinely for sale | there's been some claims to be selling vaccines | at the beginning there were also loads of listings for ppe | some just used it as a marketing tactic - fight off the virus with edible cannabis or relax with xanax and others as an excuse to raise their prices | however, sales are low compared to sales of other drugs on the site, so it is difficult to say whether its something that will really catch on | it didnt take long for complaints to come in and market owners to clamp down on anything claiming to be a miracle cure or vaccine | users were discouraging other users from profiting off the pandemic and requested markets provide health and safety information | all the major markets forbid anything being sold as a cure for covid. they flagged keywords and vendors would be told to take any listings down. they also put out psas telling people not to buy | monopoly: threatened to ban and.. you are about to ingest drugs from a stranger on the internet - under no circumstances should you trust any vendor that is using covid-19 as a marketing tool to peddle already questionable goods | it was a business decision. they dont want anything that will attract attention or that might cause desperate people who wouldnt normally use the dnms to find their way there | the idea behind dnms generally is educated and responsible drug use. they really dont want people dying - bad publicity and no repeat custom | however the dark web is rife with scammers and people willing to prey on the desperate so there are still scams out there | the only way i could ever see it becoming a thing is if there is a well-known potential cure/vaccine that is not being made widely available and could plausibly find its way onto the black market hi eileen :) my question is about how you construct your casefile episodes - i assume there is an extensive amount of outlining but do you write the final draft like a script specifically thinking about his voice? and about how long are they as far as - for example - does one hour equal 50-60 pages? thank you.|i initially write them as if i'm writing an article or book, but then go back and edit them to be read out and yes, when i do that, i do have his voice in my head lol. one episode is usually around 12,000 words. it then goes to another editor who edits the episode to be even more ""casefileaa' before it finally goes to casey have you been exposed to things in your investigations that have made you second-guess what you do? if so, what has made you keep going back?|i've definitely had days where i question everything, but to be honest, i don't really hang around the horrible really dark places much. i did delve into the child predator forums when i was writing the darkest web, but i don't make it a habit to go there. the psychonauts are much more friendly ^(the below is a reply to the above)| to continue with that- have you clicked images, links that make you a suspect in certain scenarios?|oh absolutely. sometimes i go to a ""fresh onion"" site, which is a site that crawls all the .onion addresses (dark web urls end in .onion rather than .com, org etc) and alerts you to any new ones. sometimes they don't have any description, so you take a big risk clicking on any of those. the most dangerous button on the dark web is the ""random onion"" button, so i avoid that. |i'm pretty careful about what i click, but the moment something looks questionable i nope the fuck right out of there ^(the below is a reply to the above)| have you ever felt that you may be a suspect whether it be ok a drug site, a pedo site, etc. have you ever been contacted by someone regarding your surfing habits?|well my actual surfing habits are protected by tor, which means they are hidden from prying eyes, so no i haven't been contacted about them. i am very open on the dark web about who i am and what i'm doing there - i use the name ozfreelancer on all of the markets and forums. i don't go to the sites that host child abuse images - you can't un-see that shit and i don't need it in my head. |as noted in another reply, i was contacted by homeland security on one of my visits to the us and taken for a ""friendly"" lunch. ^(the below is another reply to the original answer)| psychonauts are more friendly than most people. something about regular mind altering experiences makes you want to be less of a cunt.|yeah, i call the majestic garden a little corner of sunshine and rainbows on the dark web :) ^(the below is a reply to the above)| more about the majestic garden please?

134,"the worst flu deaths in a year in the past 10 years, in the us, was [61,000](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html).","i don't understand the obsession with comparing it with the flu.      other users have pointed out why this data isn't reliable as an accurate method of measuring the threat of this virus.      i want to be very clear, taking this virus seriously does not automatically equate to shutting down the economy. i personally am all for taking precautions that still allows the economy to function. you can listen to scientists and doctors, and take this virus seriously, without also being terrified or over reacting.     every respectable medical organization insists on taking this virus seriously, and they also agree that keeping a distance from people, wearing masks, and washing hands will help slow the spread until we get a vaccine.       i am sympathetic to the idea of using the low death rate as an argument against shutting down the economy as much as we have. i understand how that is a very compelling argument.      however, i have seen many people get hyper-focused on downplaying the virus to the point of rejecting any and all precautions, especially masks. i have seen people resort to accusing the entire medical system as corrupt liars faking deaths, rather than accepting that maybe this virus should be taken seriously.      the flu argument is especially common among the misinformation.   yes, for young people, the chances of dying are extremely low. however, there are clearly indications that there are more complications involved, permanent ones, and we still don't have the full story on that part of the risk assessment.    the covid death rate:  50+ has a 0.5% death rate according to the [cdc](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#:~:text=pre-symptomatic%20and%20asymptomatic%20contribution,the%20course%20of%20the%20infection).   the same source has 70+ at 5% death rate.      that won't wipe out the entire country, but if it hypothetically managed to spread to the point of herd immunity, then it would be [70%](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/herd-immunity-and-coronavirus/art-20486808) of the country.      using [2010 census numbers](https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf):   ages 50-70 = 71.2 million   70% = 49.8 million  ages 70+ = 27.8 million    70% = 19.5 million   0.5% deaths from 49.8 million = 249,000   5% deaths from 19.5 million = 975,000 that's 1.2 million deaths of people over 50 in order to achieve herd immunity.      i'm not saying 1.2 million people are going to die. i'm saying 0.5% and 5% may be small, but if we allow it to spread the numbers will add up to totals we should take seriously. the current totals already should be taken seriously enough to just wear a damn mask.     again, we don't have to shut down the economy in order to achieve this. we just have to believe the scientists and doctors, keep a safe distance from others and wear a mask until a vaccine can achieve a simulated herd immunity without the risk of so many deaths.      lastly, we need to shut down this flu stuff. the worst flu deaths in a year in the past 10 years, in the us, was [61,000](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html). official counts of covid-19 deaths as of time of this post have it at \~210,000 deaths this year ( [according to john hopkins university](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) ).      for those who think those deaths are fake or misdiagnosed, we can compare that to the 214,865 - 285,404 total of [excess deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm) this year according to the cdc.      this thing has killed more than 3 times as the worst flu year in the past 10 years, and we still have yet to see if a second wave adds even more deaths. wear a mask, keep a safe distance, and don't compare it to the flu.      i want to repeat a third time. none of this is an argument for shutting down the economy. only for people to avoid downplaying it in a way that contradicts the experts and numbers.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,38185,30,CovidVaccine

142,"we're going through a difficult situation as you probably know from the media in the united states, every day we seem to be setting another record.","leigh sales, presenter: dr anthony fauci has served under six presidents as the leader of america's response to infectious diseases, but none so unique as donald trump. from the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, they have been at the centre of a very public disagreement due to the president's persistent efforts to downplay the virus. donald trump, us president: every time he goes on television, there is always a bomb, but there is a bigger bomb if you fire him. fauci is a disaster. donald trump: we have more cases than anybody in the world, but why? because we do more testing. donald trump: that's all hear. i turn on the television. covid. covid. covid. covid. covid. covid. by the way on 4th november, you will not hear about it anymore. covid. dr anthony fauci: if we had, from the very beginning shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different, but there was a lot of push-back about shutting things down back then. crowd chanting: fire fauci. fire fauci. donald trump: don't tell anybody but let me wait until a little bit after the election. leigh sales: the us death toll is now nearly 240,000 and more than ten million americans are infected. dr fauci has vowed to remain in his role no matter who occupies the white house. but there is no sign yet that president trump or his political allies are willing to concede defeat. mike pompeo, us secretary of state: there will be a smooth transition to a second trump administration. right, we're ready. leigh sales: dr anthony fauci, let's start with news of pfizer's success with its vaccine trial. realistically, how soon do you think people could expect to see mass vaccinations? dr anthony fauci, director, national institute of infectious diseases: well, it is going to be a gradual process. vaccinations will start in december, very likely some time a bit before the christmas holidays. the thing that we have been dealing with in this country is a vaccine hesitancy or people really being sceptical about getting vaccinated. that is pretty much overcome when you get a vaccine of such high degree of efficacy as the pfizer vaccine which is 90 plus, closer to 95 per cent efficacious. i think those types of numbers, with no concerning safety signal, hopefully will get many, many more people than you would have predicted get vaccinated. the other thing that's important is as you probably know, this is not the only candidate that has been tested in the united states. there is another one very close behind made by a company called moderna which is a similar to, if not identical, candidate with an mrna. we likely will see results from them probably sometime i would think in the next two weeks or two-and-a-half to three weeks which means you will have two companies that will have vaccine available. leigh sales: have you had discussions yet with president-elect biden or any of his team regarding pandemic policy under the incoming administration? anthony fauci: right now, the situation as you well know, is a rather tense situation in the united states regarding transitions. so right now things are on hold for the time being. leigh sales: what would you like to see as the immediate priorities for the biden covid-19 taskforce? anthony fauci: you know, i have been talking about this now for a very long period of time and that is an adherence, essentially, uniformly throughout the country of universal wearing of masks, keeping physical distance, avoiding congregated settings or crowds particularly indoor and trying to do things more outdoors versus indoors, washing of hands. we're going through a difficult situation as you probably know from the media in the united states, every day we seem to be setting another record. leigh sales: how much culpability does president trump carry for the number of american deaths? anthony fauci: no, i'm not going to get any political discussions, i can absolutely guarantee you that you. leigh sales: well, this might also qualify as a political discussion, but let me have a try. how have you managed your dealings with president trump? anthony fauci: well, you know, i'm on the coronavirus taskforce. we had a meeting yesterday. that taskforce is chaired by vice-president pence who is in constant contact with president trump. so, there is a line of communication from the taskforce to the vice-president, from the vice-president to the president. leigh sales: what's your attitude to the use of lockdowns and when should they be undertaken? anthony fauci: well, i would like that to be almost the last resort because we know there is a considerable amount of covid-19 fatigue globally and certainly in the united states. i don't think that that would be well received. i don't think you need to lockdown. i think people have a misperception that when you say, ""wear masks. avoid crowds. keep your distance"" that that means locking down. it doesn't. you can keep businesses opened. you can keep small and large businesses open so long as you implement certain fundamental public health practises. i think it is a misperception and misleading to think that when you practise public health measures that means a lockdown. australia is an example of a very successful result of a lockdown. they locked down for a period of time. they got down to zero and now they are at a very, very good baseline, which means, getting back to your prior question, that it is much easier to identify, isolate and contact trace when you start off with virtually no infection in your population. leigh sales: how would you describe the world health organization's (who) performance throughout this? anthony fauci: well, it has been spotty. the world health organization fundamentally is a good organisation, but it is imperfect. it has flaws. we know that. leigh sales: what do you think are the lessons from the who arising from this pandemic for the next one? anthony fauci: well, i think it would be to respond in a timely manner without any indication of worrying about political ramifications and making sure the member countries, because remember, the member countries have a considerable degree of independence from central who in geneva and we need countries like china that when they get a case of a new infection to be very transparent immediately in letting the rest of the world know. we need countries like china to allow other scientists and health officials to look around and see what's going on that would be helpful. they did not allow that in the beginning. they essentially did not allow travel to wuhan. that's not a good thing. leigh sales: this is an incredible period for you to experience and you are still in the thick of it both in terms of managing a pandemic and dealing with donald trump at the same time. what has this been like for you as a human being? anthony fauci: well, it has obviously been very stressful. to deny that would be to deny reality. when you have public figures like bannon calling for your beheading, that's really kind of unusual, i think. that's not the kind of thing that you think about when you are going through medical school to be a physician. but i have gotten through it by really focussing like a laser beam on exactly what my goal is. i am a scientist and i am a physician. my goal is to help develop vaccines. i think we have been quite successful in that. now the next challenge is to develop good therapeutics and the other challenge is to get public health measures to be listened to by the american public. if you focus on that and don't get distracted by all the other noise then it is not as bad as you might think it is. it is when you start to focus on that other junk, as i call it, it is noise. it is meaningless. people calling for you to be beheaded, fired, thrown in the fire pit or whatever, that's just noise. you don't pay attention to that. leigh sales: dr fauci, thank you. we appreciate your time. anthony fauci: good to be with you. thank you for having me.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,25878,29,CovidVaccine

( though it is possible, as with other types of coronavirus, that mild infections might not provide full immunity in the short term or lifelong immunity.) the irony of successful social distancing is that fewer will develop immunity. that means that social distancing 2.0, 3.0 and, who knows, maybe even 4.0 will very likely have to occur.  the next round of social distancing will be activated more rapidly, because officials and the public will be more prepared. it should also be shorter, because we can assume that most of the people who were initially infected are likely to be immune next time around. but it will still disrupt peoples lives and the economy. we will still have canceled conferences and sporting events. people will not frequent restaurants and will not travel. the service industry will be severely curtailed. and its going to happen again and again.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"0, news copy",88501,96,CovidVaccine
147,"no, instead we were told: ""it's like the flu."" "" one day it'll just disappear."" "" it'll go away with the warmer weather."" ""","when i heard of the first cases in the us, i knew then just how bad it was going to get. i kept waiting for leadership. for someone to step up and say, this is what we need to do to survive this. this is what we know and don't know about it. something! instead, we got flaccid comments about everything but the virus.  on november 10th at 5:58 am, my best friend died from covid-19. this made it extremely personal. our daughters grew up together. every weekend our girls were having sleepovers. one at her house, the next at mine. this woman meant almost everything to me. i can't say that she meant everything because her husband has the right to that claim. she was the first one to help when i needed it. she was the first one i called when i needed that help. i was there for her when she needed me. we were very close. she was funny, caring, and most of all, she was kind. i'd known her for 33 years. she had no other ailments and had just turned 51 years old. she was thin and healthy.  she caught the virus at her daughter's wedding. i virtually watched because of the pandemic. there was only 11 people at the wedding but one of them gave it to her. she was otherwise careful. always wearing a mask in public but surely no one in her family would be so foolish as to show up at that wedding at her home with covid so they didn't wear masks! four days after the wedding, she started having trouble breathing. she tried all the ""local (400 mile radius)"" hospitals but they were all full. as they approached a hospital six hours away, a nurse came out to inform them that they too were full but she'd make some phone calls. there was a hospital another two hours away that could take her. so, off they went. it took 19 hours to find a hospital with a bed for her. by the time she arrived, she couldn't speak, had a high fever, was too weak to walk, was in and out of consciousness, and was vomiting phlegm.  nine days later, while on a ventilator, she developed high blood pressure because of the medications they had her on. they were going to try to lower her blood pressure but she died before that could happen. the autopsy showed that the pulmonary artery had burst from blood clots. she died alone, ten hours from her home, in an icu in another state because all the beds were taken by other covid patients. we live in a rural area where there is less than 60,000 people in the entire county. we have one local hospital with only 214 beds and the emergency room is closed because the entire hospital is completely filled with covid patients. there is only three ventilators in that hospital.  now, who gave her the virus? good question. her asymptomatic husband gave her covid-19. he has to live with knowing that fact. he didn't know he had it at all. he'd gone shopping for the wedding items without a mask. he wasn't ever sick but he tested positive for having antibodies from it. as he said at her virtual funeral, ""i killed her just as much as pointing a gun at her and pulling the trigger. and i gave it to my daughter and her new husband too. i could've lost them too.""  everyone who knew her, loved and respected her. she's gone. no one and nothing can change that. but i can't help but think that our leaders failed us in so many ways. they do have a part in her death. that is my belief.  i used to look at the number of people (reported and confirmed) to have the virus and wish i could help them. i used to look at the number of deaths each day and wish there was something that i could do to help those with the virus and to help each their loved one's pain and suffering when they died. now, it is personal and i wish it even more. all i can do is wear a mask to keep my germs to myself.  the people in power didn't do their jobs. they didn't order ventilators and personal protection equipment for the hospitals, staff, and clinics. no supplies were given to help anyone. they didn't quarantine the military to protect the nation with rotational shifts of work. they didn't care enough about their citizens to protect them at all. not even simple information. no, instead we were told: ""it's like the flu."" "" one day it'll just disappear."" "" it'll go away with the warmer weather."" "" you don't need a mask just stay six feet away from everyone."" "" you need a mask at least three layers thick."" "" it'll be gone completely by november 4th. you'll not ever hear of it ever again."" this isn't political. it is just the feeling of being betrayed by all of them. they knew the truth and decided to not share it. instead, they sold their stock because they knew how bad it was going to hurt the economy and the stock market.  so, i do feel more depressed. overwhelmed is a good word for it. empty and in pain. cold inside. somewhat happy to have a glimmer of hope about a vaccine. but just greatly saddened about everyone who died from the virus and who will die from it before the vaccine can slow down the deaths.  it hasn't been enough time to know all of the after effects of the virus. who knows what all will happen to the bodies of those who've had the virus? sterility? brain and lung problems? who knows? there hasn't been enough time and studies done about it. so, add that to the depressed view of all of this.  i've thought long and hard about this year. i think it all comes down to selfishness. not caring about others enough to care what happens to all of us. 2020 sucks and my thoughts are, what if 2021 says, ""here, hold my beer and watch this!""",1,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"0, the comment has much better instances of storytelling than this one, I don't know if those are also predicted",5025,36,CovidVaccine

150,"the who says more than 2,900 people have died. south korea in early february had a technologically advanced, transparent, well-funded plan to confront the coronavirus.","full text: to enter the nine-story shincheonji church of jesus building feb. 16, the 61-year-old woman needed to press her finger into a digital scanner. she was nursing a sore throat and a fever, local health officials report, and any doctor would have advised her to stay homeespecially as the new coronavirus lurked in south korea. but skipping sunday service wasnt an option: church leaders take attendance by checking a followers shincheonji-issued photo id, said current and former church members. pushing through the glass door, she would have walked by a first-floor museum dedicated to the groups founder, lee man-hee, who members believe immortal. she descended into a basement worship hall with no windows or furniture. she spent roughly two hours there, health officials determined, crammed shoulder-to-shoulder sitting on her knees on the floor with about 1,000 others. hewing to the churchs strict routine, she would have embraced others repeatedly, wailing amen! the spiritual moment was a perfect incubator for disease, as was the church. on feb. 17, health officials diagnosed the 61-year-old as south koreas 31st coronavirus patient, later declaring her patient zero for the wave of shincheonji-linked cases. she had also attended services the sunday before. health officials trace about three-fifths of the countrys 3,736 cases to her as of march 1. it was like they sprayed the virus within the church, said a city official in daegu, which has about 2.4 million residents. the shincheonji outbreak represents a worst-case combination of factors seen in other coronavirus outbreakslarge gatherings, participants fanning out into public, delays in identifying the threat, slow or hindered responses. days before the lockdown of wuhan, china, where the virus spread originated, wuhan officials held an annual residents banquet for more than 10,000 families. passengers on a cruise ship docking in japan mingled for days after its first confirmed case. in singapore, it took 10 days for health authorities to realize a cluster of infections had formed at a sales conference there and spread abroad.  religion complicated the recipe for disaster in south korea, pitting the government against an enigmatic church that has an allergy to outsiders and teaches members they will live forever, according to former members. the broader global crisis harks back to december, when china disclosed the outbreak after dozens fell ill in wuhan. the virus spread in china, where 79,394 people had been sickened as of feb. 29, according to the world health organization, and there have been 6,009 confirmed cases in 53 other countries, with south korea at no. 2. the who says more than 2,900 people have died. south korea in early february had a technologically advanced, transparent, well-funded plan to confront the coronavirus. but the outbreak at the secretive church with its rituals that demand mass human contact punched a hole in the defenses. shincheonji members, pressured to recruit followers, travel across a country the geographic size of indiana. most acolytes hide their shincheonji ties from their families. the government recently called shincheonji a korean cult. to shincheonji members, their priority is not the safety issue, said ji-il tark, a busan presbyterian university theology professor who studies the group, but rather protecting their own organization. the groups opacity stymies some fundamentals of outbreak prevention. without a coronavirus vaccine, officials must bank on healthy individuals to avoid contact with the sick. when infections occur, institutions and individuals must quickly share information to locate the virus source and prevent further spread. failure to do so creates distrust, and distrust disrupts transparency, said tim brown, an infectious-disease researcher at the east-west center who has consulted with the who, making containment even more challenging, if not impossible. health officials say they dont fully know who might be covertly carrying the illness because, they contend, shincheonji is withholding information. daegus mayor said at a friday briefing he is taking legal action against shincheonjis leadership for lying about the number of followers and facilities. gyeonggi-do province, near seoul, has twice raided its headquarters to unearth more information. if we can prevent contact with shincheonji-linked patients, daegu mayor kwon young-jin said wednesday, we will be able to prevent the virus from spreading to other regions. shincheonji in a friday press conference said it is cooperating with the investigation, has shut its facilities and believes its members are the victims. it denied concealing information. baek in-yeop, a planning-department executive at the daegu shincheonji church, said in an interview he and 15 other followers rushed to get the city a list of the more than 1,000 people who attended the same two sunday services as the 61-year-old. any discrepancies, he said, were honest mistakes or a result of not having full information on certain members.  mr. baek said he didnt attend the same services but was in the building and saw followers wearing masks. hand sanitizer had been placed around the building. its a witch hunt against us, mr. baek said between coughs, noting that he was tested for coronavirus and expected the results soon. they frame us as if we are a devil organization. we are daegu citizens before being shincheonji members. south korean officials said they havent pinpointed how the 61-year-old, who hadnt traveled abroad recently, contracted coronavirus. the government has pledged to test every shincheonji member in the country, after receiving a list of 210,000 members on wednesday. the group later released names of roughly 100,000 others, mostly including shincheonji trainees who had yet to become full members by finishing six months of education and passing a written test, health officials said. over the past week, more than 1.1 million citizens had signed a petition to the presidential blue house demanding shincheonji be dismantled. frustrated koreans include jeon in-sook, 47, a daegu nurse. a co-worker contracted the virus and landed in a hospital room with several shincheonji members who urged her to join the church. theres no difference, she said, between shincheonji and north korea. south korean health officials have said they expect the countrys confirmed cases to keep rising. jpmorgan chase & co. said it anticipates infections for daegu alone to reach 10,000 and peak around march 20. two weeks ago, the country had diagnosed only 30 patients, just before the tally began mushrooming after the virus hit shincheonji. since granting itself maximum authority on feb. 23 to block the virus spread, seoul has struggled to free up hospital beds, doctors and key supplies. it has injected more than $13 billion of emergency funds into its paralyzed economy. uncertainty is seeding paranoia for people like jeon so-young, 31, who lives near the daegu shincheonji church and believes a co-worker may have been a member after her office building closed for disinfection. it feels like a game now, she said, trying to figure out if people around me are shincheonji members. fears appeared validated last week when an infection-prevention manager at a daegu health center dealing with the outbreak had to step aside, said mayor kwon at a briefing, because he was a shincheonji follower. the follower has since tested positive.  the news didnt surprise kim jin-sook, 49, who attended the daegu shincheonji church until late last year. for three years, ms. kim, a piano teacher, sneaked to services by telling her husband she had a sunday tutoring session. even when not at shincheonji, she could open a secret phone app where she could watch the founders sermons, she said; i lived a double life. mr. lee, 89, founded shincheonji in 1984. born near daegu, he joined several cults before creating his own doctrine, said shin hyun-wook, a former senior shincheonji official who manages a website about the churchs history and tactics. mr. lee is a self-proclaimed savior, an embodiment of christ with exclusive scriptural knowledge who presses members to recruit new followers, said current and former members. shincheonji says global membership stands around 245,000 and it aspires to hit a million in three years. how should governments work with tight-knit groups, such as the shincheonji church, as they try to stem the spread of coronavirus? join the conversation below. the city of seoul has sent prosecutors a legal complaint that accused mr. lee and other senior shincheonji leaders of homicide, causing harm and violating the countrys infectious-disease law, seouls mayor said in a facebook post on sunday. a formal probe could follow. continued below",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,93651,31,CovidVaccine

  atmosphere: i'm not into country music so i don't really know much about this celebrity that's hocking this shit, but in stead of that garbage music (sorry country music fans) i've got knuckle puck's latest album ""20/20"" spinning on the record player this afternoon as i get set to review the 2020 survival kit from redneck riviera and it's celebrity sponsor. music: knuckle puck - ""breathe"" 	""if the world has opened up beneath your feet 	and youre pushing daisies up from underneath 	when all you need is just beyond your reach 	just dont forget, don't forget to breathe""     redneck riviera whiskey american whiskey 40% alcohol by volume age & bottle info: 95% american light whiskey aged 2 years / 5% american whiskey aged 1 year distilled and bottled by info: unknown source, bottled by redneck riviera whiskey co. tasting vessel: glencairn glass, neat resting for 10 minutes. color: darker than i expected basically a 2 year old whiskey to be even at 40%. i'm not convinced there isn't added color here. nose: vanilla, sweet corn, artificial sweetener, honey the nose isn't as bad as i was expecting to be honest, pretty basic and straight forward artificial sweetener vanilla/honey. after a few sips i revisit the nose and there is more astringency and alcohol vapors present overpowering some of the sweet notes. mouth feel: minimal flavor: well this isn't offensive. it is very sweet, almost like a flavored whiskey. it tastes like i'm drinking a honey flavored whiskey. vanilla and honey, just like on the nose. this has two notes, vanilla and honey, i don't know how many sips i've had and that is all that is fucking here. zero complexity.  overall: it was honestly a lot better than i thought but then again i was going in expecting a drain pour so it didn't have much room for going down. this isn't offensive but it also isn't very good. it is extremely one dimensional basically just vanilla and honey and while not bad it just comes off as i would expect a flavored whiskey. to some extent i'm skeptical if there wasn't flavoring or color added despite the bottle not indicating that.   score: 67/100  redneck riviera whiskey granny rich reserve american whiskey 43% alcohol by volume age & bottle info: 95% american light whiskey aged 3 years / 5% american malt whiskey aged 4 years distilled and bottled by info: unknown source, bottled by redneck riviera whiskey co. tasting vessel: glencairn glass, neat resting for 10 minutes. color: light, like a well hydrated stool sample.  nose: similar to the regular bottling really sweet, artificially so, vanilla and honey, more vanilla mouth feel: a little creamier mouth feel on this one compared to the other bottle, but still pretty light.  flavor: first sip and really fucking sweet much like the other bottle. honestly it just tastes like a vanilla and honey flavored whiskey. quite a few sips down now and like the other bottle, i'm trying to find the complexity and there just isn't any, this is vanilla and honey. while the one difference between this and the regular bottling is the slight change in proof point which does give a little bit more on the finish which is just a little peppery but still really just meh. overall: upping the proof and age on this one versus the standard offering did not help it at all. it is very much the same as the regular but just comes off as more harsh. it could have scored the same as the regular but the final sip i had just was not good and made me question why the hell i put myself through this.  score: 66/100  overall thoughts: i think it is important to point out the biggest problems with this 2020 survival kit. first, it is not a vaccine or treatment for covid it will only help numb your senses to the people around you. second, it isn't even a high enough proof to be used as a hand sanitizer or an internal disinfectant (bleach to the veins am i right? no seriously don't do that you are an idiot don't do that). third, the granny rich reserve bottle is plastic so you can't even break it and use it as a personal protective device against the impending zombie apocalypse that is sure to come next. back to the whiskey itself, it was better than i expected but then again when i decided to subject myself to this i expected drain pour only type scores so there really wasn't much worse it could go. if you're into flavored whiskey then this wouldn't be too bad but i am not. this will sit in the basement far from my bar cabinet until we can have people over again, and then it will be just used as a shooter to get rid of this shit.  lastly, i'm not the best with words like the (deleted) u/hatpocket, wish he was still around reddit writing reviews because i'm sure he would have a great one for this!  music pairing: i chose this album for this pairing specifically because of the title ""20/20"" and it's release this year. it came out in september of this year with singles being released for it as early as february. while i don't know if there was any added significance to the year 2020 beyond the title track ""20/20"" refencing ""20/20 hindsight"" or something more here it still is a really enjoyable album. it isn't my favorite from knuckle puck but it is still a great listen from start to finish. i don't think these whiskey's really lent themselves to this pairing though, i could never really get into a zone with the music and the whiskey, and this was not the music's fault. these whiskeys were forgettable at best, unlike this album. i plan to pair this album with something else in the future to see if more can come out of it. while this survival kit will not really help you this year this album might, there are some great tracks focused on self help when everything around you is crumbling. the track ""breathe"" that i pulled a lyric from above is one such track. as everything is super fucked this year and this holiday season, just take a step back and breathe and appreciate what we do have even if that is only this shitty 2020 survival kit.   scoring scale: my scoring does not take into account cost of the bottle/pour. it is solely based on the spirit alone. 100 - whiskey nirvana. 95-99 - near perfection: this is everything i want in whiskey. | examples: elijah craig barrel proof c919 91-94 - incredible: outstanding profile i could enjoy forever if the bottle lasted that long. | examples: elijah craig barrel proof, stagg jr., four roses le smb (2018) 87-90 - excellent: an excellent pour i must keep on hand at all times (if i can that is). | examples: bookers, weller 12, old forester rye, ardbeg uigeadail 84-86 - great: would happily grab a bottle of this (price dependent of course), there are only a few things holding it back from excellence. | examples: colonel e.h. taylor single barrel, wild turkey rare breed, caol ila 12 year 80-83 - really good: this is a really good whiskey but not very unique. | examples: old grand dad bottled in bond, four roses yellow label, laphroaigh 10 year 76-79 - good: still a good pour, but, lots i'd rather have. primarily mixed in cocktails but can have it neat too. | example: weller special reserve, evan williams black label, smooth ambler old scout 107 72-75 - this doesn't suck: i'd have a glass in a pinch but would seek alternatives first. | example: makers mark, four roses small batch, johnny drum 66-71 - this only kind of sucks: usually pass it up, at best it's a mixer with coke or similar. | example: willett pot still reserve, wild turkey longbranch, jim beam black 60-65 i enjoy [malort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7s16ewp1ru) but not this: i'd rather take shots of malort but this will work as a shooter in a pinch. | examples: koval single barrel bourbon 0-59 - only suitable for the sewage system. | examples: thankfully i've mostly avoided these so far.  review stats: min score 49, max score 95, average score 81 network review #137 & #138 r/bourbon review #127 & # 128",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,13413,28,CovidVaccine

156,"to this i1 simply replied, ""read and research. you want me to explain to you in a few paragraphs a ten year journey that i have been on for truth.","part 2: i2's reply, ""i can answer your question.. i follow people that are real journalists.. have been for many years.. i follow at least 30-40 people.. all have different backgrounds and different sources.. some have worked for the government or military, cia... some just regular humans trying to get the truth out.. and i used to work for the government as well and have witnessed much evil.. from 25 years ago.."" my response, ""i want to be sure i'm not misrepresenting you; so what you're saying, if i understand, is that you follow many different people (at least 30 or 40) and based on their collective reporting you feel that you are getting an accurate picture of the truth? and that these people, coming from different sources and backgrounds, gives them a wide range of collective expertise? i think it makes sense that getting information from a variety of different sources probably helps get a better perspective of the ""big picture"". how often do you feel that your sources conflict with one another? and when that happens, how do you decide which one is more likely to be ""correct""? and when one of these sources tells you that another source is ""fake news"" how do you determine the truth of the matter?  i guess what i'm getting at is, how can you test for yourself rather than just trusting media reports? for example, one internet website says that covid-19 was made in a lab in wuhan by bill gates so that he can inject people with vaccines filled with poisons in order to reduce the population. another website says it's not even a real virus, but that the illness is being caused by 5g signals in order for bill gates (he pops up a lot) to inject us with vaccines which are actually microchips so that a shadowy world government can track everyone. another says it doesn't exist at all and it's just made up by the press as bad publicity as an attempt to keep trump from being re-elected. another says it was caused by someone eating a bat and that it's already mutating and will come in wave after wave, decimating the population and the economy.  so i'm just wondering, how do you decide which of these reports is true, and which are ""fake news""? do you decide by going with the story that the majority of your sources agree with? do you decide based on occam's razor? do you look at the raw data from the original sources/scientific reports and do your own analysis? do you trust official government reports? do you just go with what ""feels"" right? do you throw in with what your friends and/or family believes? there are many ways to decide what to believe. do you think some are more valid than others, and if so, which do you use?"" at this i1 jumped back in, but her response has since been edited and no longer resembles her original reply which was basically just a link to another youtube video. i decided to humor her and watch it. to this i responded, ""i appreciate your replies, but i'm afraid those videos really don't answer any of my questions. they just portray a particular perspective, but they don't tell me anything about why you find that perspective more believable than any other. the narrator makes a lot of claims but offers no real data to back any of it up, and offers no sources or ways to check or verify what he is saying is accurate. he says things like, ""how do they know there's going to be a second wave?"" but he doesn't show the many reasons why they think one is likely (nor does he show evidence that anyone ever said that there would be one, just that there likely could be one). then he leaves the viewer to assume that it must be due to a conspiracy, without offering any evidence that this is the case. why should i believe him more than any other media pundit? in the video he says, ""i'm here to tell you that covid-19 is a distraction."" okay, but he sites no data or sources for what he is telling me. that's what i'm trying to get at. you say i should think for myself, and that i should do my own research. but linking to someone telling me what to think and believe is not research. how do you do your own research? how do you verify that the things that the man in the video you linked to (or anyone else for that matter) are saying are actually true? how do you determine which news is fake, and which is not? you say that i need to open my mind and heart and listen. would you say that i am being closed minded for asking why you believe that what someone is saying is true? if so, what would you suggest i should do to open my mind? also, what exactly does it mean to open my heart? i genuinely don't know; i'm not trying to be pedantic. i am trying to engage in genuine discussion and i don't want to misunderstand or misstate your position. i just want to know why you believe what you do, how you verify that your position is correct when you say that people who believe differently have been misled by fake news."" to this i1 simply replied, ""read and research. you want me to explain to you in a few paragraphs a ten year journey that i have been on for truth. it's your journey ... go with what resonates for you. wish you the best."" at this point others began pointing out the fallacies in her reasoning and i sort of felt that i was not going to get much further as she didn't seem to want to engage in my line of questioning. she started telling them that she relies on a higher source for information, ""god"", and so on. eventually i2 came back and responded to me again with, ""all you have said is very valid... all my resources have basically the same views.. minor differences. but yes i go with my initial gut feeling.. or what is common sense to me.. could be wrong or right.. over the last 30 years watching all of this hysteria and fear, in response to the media.. i have been right on the money..putting two and two together, the media is owned by the money.. celebs are owned by the money, the democrats are owned by the money..they are all puppets to the money.. we all need to focus our attention to all the kids that are being abducted every year... they are raped and murdered..over a million every year!!!"" that's pretty much up to date. i think i1 is afraid to explore the reasoning behind her belief system, but at least i2 seems to be willing to admit now that they might be wrong, and that they are going more on feelings than on research or verifiable facts, which is a huge difference from where they were before i got involved in the discussion.  the conversation is still active and hasn't been deleted yet, which i think shows that it is sometimes possible to shift the entire tone of a conversation by injecting some calm attempts to understand and encouraging rational thought rather than back-and-forth name calling and arguing. also, even if i didn't seem to make much of a dent in i1's position, at least she seems to have calmed down and isn't using pejoratives in this particular conversation thread anymore.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,68442,34,CovidVaccine

( thats the beauty of qanon, its foundation is built on something 90% of the world can get on board with, and is evidenced by a lot of the epstein scandal). added to that, probably some jibberish about vaccines, 5g, and covid.  2. there is actually deep state that is orchestrating this. primarily the american democratic party (weirdly, despite it being global cabal), some business tycoons, celebrities, uhhh scientists, journalistsjust anyone smarter than me really. trump is working against them. a storm is coming #thegreatawakening  3. this shadowy cabal? so about thattheyre satanists! and theyre performing sacrifices, eating babies, extracting adrenochomeyou know the deal. i am a digital solider in an information war.  4. trump is divine. god has appointed him on a holy crusade. he often sends me messages through misspelled tweets. jfk? you mean future vice president jfk? did i say satanists? i meant lizards  it could probably be broken down into many different levels, but the point is they probably all consider what they believe is actually qanon. recently ive been wondering whether it is something to be worried about or not. and im torn. below are my thoughts and id be happy to hear yours.  this is nothing these people have always existed. the dim-witted, the disenfranchised, the angry, the trolls, the crazies, the gullible. all thats changed is that is through social media they have been gradually finding each over the last decade. groups align with other likeminded groups and grow. insulating themselves from criticism. and qanon represents a banner for all these groups to unite under. but the way i see it is that the idiots are just all now in one place now. i mean, when they invented the first insane asylum im sure they didnt say, the worlds getting crazier. no! theyre just all here in the same place where we can see them.  then added to that, these are exceptional times and some normally reasonable people have been sucked in. covid, lockdowns, masks. people are unemployed, angry, trapped at home, and confused. perhaps qanon fills their time, gives them a purpose or even answers. but covid will pass. then theres trump inciting divisions globally, he too will pass; whether its november or 2024. then the epstein scandal happens in the middle of all this. the world will be boring again one day, hopefully.  and lastly, for the most part is they are do nothing bitches. they obsessively and excessively post garbage on facebook (with most of their friends having deleted them already) and their new comrades repost the garbage. the only tool they have is disinformation, and realistically who is listening to that kid from your class who ate crayons and failed high school, except that other kid who ate crayons and failed high school?  this is worrying i think qanon movement will pass, or more likely eat itself from within. no matter how disengaged from reality you are, i still believe theres only so much of the storm is coming..now.no wait nooow..that was disinformationits cooooooming now.no wait before you move on. however, that group of people continually finding a home together online continues to grow, regardless of the name oh, you support brexit? have you heard about the dangers of vaccinations against 5g? let me tell you about microchips! were in this weird anti-intellectual era that truly adopts the wwg1wga mentality. i honestly dont see how that ever changes.  and to be honest no one is immune. i saw the same behaviors in r/themueller as youd see in r/thedonald. bombshell dropping today reports that trump arrest imminent echo chambers, anonymous sources, and the instantaneous acceptance of anything that fits your narrative. even today, one of the top stories on reddit was anonymous reports that trump called injured and dead war veterans losers and suckers. if you cant approach that headline with any semblance of skepticism then i dont know what to say. everything is politicised now, and everyone has chosen their side with a reluctance to even consider their own bias.",1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"0, what about a clear personal story where the argumentative goal/stance is not discernible?",431,31,CovidVaccine

166,a study in 2015 by huggy rao of stanford university and sunasir dutta of the university of minnesota found that people were less likely to favour legalising irregular immigrants if told about a new strain of flu.,"full text (part 2 of 2)  many governments have criminalised fake news about the pandemic. often, this means commentary that displeases the ruling party. nicaraguas regime plans to ban news that causes alarm, fear or anxiety. el salvador has relaunched a state television outlet, having purged 70 journalists since president nayib bukele came to power last year. i am watching a very balanced newscast, grinned mr bukele. i dont know what the opposition will see.  anyone in zimbabwe who publishes or disseminates false information about an official, or that impedes the response to the pandemic, faces up to 20 years in prison. two journalists were arrested when they tried to visit in hospital three opposition activists, including an mp, who had been abducted, tortured and forced to drink urine by ruling-party thugs.   all around the world, ordinary people are being gagged, too. some 116 citizen journalists are currently imprisoned, says reporters without borders. in uzbekistan people entering quarantine facilities have had to hand over their phones, supposedly to prevent the devices from spreading the virus but actually so they cannot take photos of the woeful conditions inside.   medics, who see covid-19 fiascos close up, face extra pressure to shut up. chinas rulers silenced the doctors in wuhan who first sounded the alarm about the new virus. censorship can be lethal. had china listened to doctors and acted faster to curb the disease, it would not have spread so fast around the world.   still, other regimes have copied chinas example. in september the turkish medical association accused turkeys government of downplaying the outbreak. a ruling-party ally called for the group to be shut down and its leaders investigated for stoking panic. yet the doctors were right. the health ministry later admitted that its daily figures did not include asymptomatic patients. an opposition lawmaker shared a document suggesting that the true number of cases in a single day in september was 19 times the official tally.   egypts government says it is coping admirably with the pandemic. a dozen doctors have been arrested for suggesting otherwise, as have several journalists. one, mohamed monir, died of covid-19 contracted during detention.   of the 24 countries that had national elections scheduled between january and august, nine were disrupted by the pandemic. some delays were justified. but as south korea showed, a ballot can be held safely if suitable precautions are taken. some other governments were in no hurry. sri lankas president gotabaya rajapaksa dissolved the opposition-controlled parliament in march and did not allow fresh elections until august. in the meantime, he ran the country without lawmakers to check him.   in hong kong pro-democracy candidates were expected to do well in elections in september. citing the risk of covid-19, the territorys pro-communist leaders delayed them for a year. burundis election in may was probably never going to be clean, but the virus supplied the perfect excuse to exclude pesky foreign observers. twelve days before the election they were told that they would have to quarantine on arrival in the country for 14 days, thus missing the vote.   in russia vladimir putin has turned the virus to his advantage. he shifted responsibility for a strict lockdown to regional governors, but then took credit for easing it. in the summer he held a constitutional pseudo-referendum to allow himself to stay in office until 2036. citing public health, he extended the vote to a week and allowed people to vote at home, in courtyards, in playgrounds and on tree stumps. the vote was impossible to observe or verify. mr putin declared a resounding victory. parliament voted to change the voting procedure permanently.   in countries with too few checks and balances, rules to curb the virus can be used for other ends. on a dark road in senegal, a policeman recently stopped a taxi and detained the driver for wearing his anti-covid mask on his chin. after 45 minutes, shaking with fury, the driver returned to his vehicle. the cop had threatened him with dire punishments unless he handed over some cash, he explained to his passenger, a reporter for the economist. he drove off as fast as he could, cursing.   while petty officials abuse the rules to pad their wages, strongmen typically abuse them to crush dissent. police assaulted civilians in 59 countries and detained them in 66 for reasons linked to the pandemic. violence was most common in countries freedom house classifies as partly free, where people are not yet too scared to protest, but their rulers would like them to be.   in zimbabwe, for example, many of the 34 new regulations passed during a national lockdown are still in place, and have been used as a pretext for myriad abuses. in september the zimbabwe human rights ngo forum, an umbrella group, released a report listing 920 cases of torture, extrajudicial killings, unlawful arrests and assaults on citizens by the security services in the first 180 days of lockdown. one man was forced to roll around in raw sewage. many had dogs set on them. dozens of opposition activists have been arrested or beaten, including a former finance minister. there were too many everyday cases of intimidation and harassment to count.   many strongmen are also chipping away at pre-pandemic checks on their power. nicaragua has borrowed an idea from mr putin: a law will require ngos that receive foreign funding to register as foreign agents. india used similar rules to shut down the local arm of amnesty international, which closed in september after its bank accounts were frozen.   in kazakhstan trials are taking place on zoom, leading some defendants in politically charged cases to complain that this makes it easy for judges to have selective hearing. alnur ilyashev, a pro-democracy campaigner who was sentenced to three years of restricted movement for disseminating false information, said he could not always hear his own trial.   nothing spreads like fear   panic about a contagious disease makes people irrational and xenophobic. a study in 2015 by huggy rao of stanford university and sunasir dutta of the university of minnesota found that people were less likely to favour legalising irregular immigrants if told about a new strain of flu. many autocrats, even if they have not read the academic literature, grasp that blaming out-groups is a good way to win support.   mr modis government tars muslims as superspreaders. bulgaria imposed harsher lockdowns on romany neighbourhoods than on others. turkeys religious authorities blame gay people. malaysian officials blame migrant workers, some of whom have been caned and deported.   minorities have had an especially grim time in myanmar. aung san suu kyi, the countrys de facto president, threatened severe penalties for residents who re-enter the country illegally. people understood this to refer to the rohingyas, a persecuted muslim group, roughly 1m of whom have fled into neighbouring countries. the rumour that rohingyas were infecting the nation spread rapidly. a cartoon circulating online showed a rohingya man, labelled as an illegal interloper, crossing the border, carrying covid-19.   meanwhile, a un rapporteur warns that the pandemic has emboldened myanmars army, which has stepped up its war on secessionists. the arakan army, a rebel group, offered ceasefires in april, june and september; all were rebuffed. in may and june the army bombed civilians, razed villages and tortured non-combatants, says amnesty international. some 200,000 have fled to camps for displaced people, according to a local ngo, the rakhine ethnics congress. since covid-19 struck, donations have declined and supplies of food to the camps have dwindled.   abusers and autocrats have not had it all their own way this year. the pandemic has drained their treasuries. their finances will still be wobbly even when a vaccine is found and the public-health excuse for curbs on freedom is no longer plausible.   and people are pushing back. although 158 countries have imposed restrictions on demonstrations, big protests have erupted in at least 90 since the pandemic began. furious crowds in kyrgyzstan this month forced the government to order a re-run of a tainted election. protests in nigeria prompted the government to disband a notoriously torture-and-murder-prone police unit on october 11th. mass rallies in belarus have so far failed to reverse a rigged election there, but have made it clear that the dictator, alexander lukashenko, has lost the consent of his people.   institutions are pushing back, too. a court in lesotho barred the prime minister from using the virus as an excuse to close parliament. russias opposition parties refuse to be cowed even by the poisoning of their main leader, alexei navalny.   with luck, when covid-19 eventually recedes, the global atmosphere of fear will recede with it. people may find the capacity to care a bit more about abuses that occur far away, or to people unlike themselves. they may even elect leaders who speak up for universal values. but for the time being, the outlook is grim.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,33738,38,CovidVaccine

175,"i don't know exactly what you mean, but i'm a research scientist in biochemistry and microbiology. my work touches on a couple areas including cell biology, molecular biology, structural biology, and drug/molecular probe development.","what you've said is broadly true, but there are mistakes or conclusions that can't be made yet. i'll do my best to break it down. i'll note that i'm a scientist, not a doctor, so there could also be flaws in my understanding of the pathology. i can speak more authoritatively on the molecular basis of the infection than i can on the medical impacts. so if you have any questions on papers you've seen or how the virus actually invades/takes over cells i can try to help.  the virus is highly infective, it can practically enter via any open hole on the human body, like the eyeballs (that is why medics wear eye covers when treating patients) broadly true. as far as i'm aware, covid19 is primarily spread via respiratory droplets. essentially, large (relatively) droplets of water that are expelled when you sneeze/cough/speak spray out over a short (~6 feet is the current guideline for covid) distance. if these droplets encounter a mucus membrane such as the ones in the mouth, nose, eyes etc. then the virus can be deposited and infect. but, there are many ""holes"" across the body in microscopic forms that aren't necessarily susceptible. transmission is complicated and can be hard to trace.  it has a quite low death toll. it is 3.8% in my country and higher or lower depending on the country. flu has a death rate of 0,14% these numbers are harder to pin down. for the regular flu, it's probably less severe but we also have vaccines which cut down on the spread and ensure that the medical system is able to provide adequate care to anyone who gets sick. one of the dangers here is that people who are treatable may still not get help because of a lack of supplies. the 3.8% number is also probably inaccurate. it does seem to be more deadly, but by definition the death rate is tied to overall number of cases. since many cases will be mild, and diagnoses are limited by availability of tests and people choosing to go to the hospital, there are probably many more cases we don't know about. the best we can do is estimate, so those numbers are hazy. it'll take a few years after this subsides for us to really get an idea of the impact.  it is very likely that it will kill millions. it's really hard to know at this point. deaths could range from a few thousand to half a million, to over a million. if it is as severe as the 1918 epidemic, the equivalent would be between 1-2 million deaths. but healthcare has improved dramatically since then so who knows.  this is the main reason for the governments to contain the virus, all the innocent deaths. the main reason you're seeing such drastic containment measures is because they are attempting to slow the progression. it's likely that between 1/4-1/3rd of the population at least will be infected at some point. if all of those infections occur at the same time, hospitals will simply not have enough beds, respirators, and doctors to help everyone. this is what is happening in italy right now. instead, the quarantines are an attempt to slow down the rate of infection. this is known colloquially as [""flattening the curve'](https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/covid-flattening-curve-20200313/img/_ai2html-graphic-wide.jpg). the washington post [has a great overview](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) of different containment strategies and how they work.  you do not die of covid-19, you die of pneumonia, for example. this is a semantic difference. the cause of death would be covid-19. the mechanism of death would be viral pneumonia. it's like saying someone died of a gunshot but the cause of death is homicide.  pneumonia is a inflammatory condition. when the virus reaches the lungs it starts killing the cells. immune response can lead to more cell death. the death of those cells and the ensuing inflammatory response essentially suffocates you. the actual cause of death is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) wherein cells fill with fluid and blood loses oxygenation.  i also know that virus normally have a higher infectivity rate than bacteria because they are extremely small compare to them this is really hard to compare. most viruses are smaller than bacteria, but that doesn't necessarily make them more infectious and/or contagious. a major factor in transmission is how well the virus/bacterium is able to tolerate transmission. your dog can easily pass a dog virus to you, but the virus may not be suitable to human cells and degrade harmlessly whereas a bacterium passed from your dog would survive better. viruses can physically get into you better, but because of their simplicity and reliance on the host have a harder time grabbing hold.  but they can be deactivated via destroying the capside, which allows cell recognition and attatchment, or via destroying the genetic information it contains, with severe ph or temperature changes or uv light. those are some methods. viruses are often more complicated than the commonly known model of a viral capsid with genetic material inside. they can be covered in membranes, glycoproteins, sugars, and other molecules. covid19 in particular enters cells by employing a protein (called a spike, which gives coronavirus its name) embedded in the capsid that reaches out and binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), tethering it to the cell. it then recruits a cellular protease which ultimately fuses the viral membrane to the cellular membrane, after which the virus is endocytosed and imported into the cell.  others involve vaccines that can help the immune system destroy infected cells, small molecules to block the activity of viral proteases, retrotranscriptases, viral integrases etc. cells also have a myriad of defense strategies such as the famous crispr-cas system (amongst many, many others).  btw what is a phd? a phd is a doctor of philosophy, so yes, a doctorate in science.  and are you working or investigating? i don't know exactly what you mean, but i'm a research scientist in biochemistry and microbiology. my work touches on a couple areas including cell biology, molecular biology, structural biology, and drug/molecular probe development. but my overall point is that even knowing all of these things, you still don't have anywhere near enough information to make recommendations for public health. as a phd who knows intimately how these things work, i don't even have enough information. i study proteins and nucleic acids. there are people who obtain graduate degrees in public health that are far more suited to make recommendations on the best ways to control disease outbreaks and protect lives. we need to listen to them, and them only.",1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"1, this is the typical experiential knowledge storytelling ""As a teacher"", but the experience after

[...]","choice bits:  dr. anthony fauci expressed ""cautious optimism"" about the initial results from a coronavirus vaccine trial results that were widely celebrated this week and says it remains ""conceivable"" that a vaccine for the deadly pathogen could be available by the end of the year.  amid a global arms race for a vaccine, the nation's leading infectious disease expert said friday in an interview with npr that he was encouraged by findings from the phase 1 trial of a vaccine under development by researchers at the massachusetts-based biotech company moderna. on monday, the company said the vaccine appears both safe and capable of stimulating in test subjects the type of immune response needed to ward off an infection.  but the company, which is developing the vaccine in collaboration with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, which fauci leads, has yet to publish detailed results from the trial, fueling concerns among researchers about how much the announcement can be trusted.  addressing those concerns, fauci said full details from the trial are now being compiled by his team at the niaid, but said, ""having looked at the data myself, it is really quite promising.""  ""the vaccine induced what we call neutralizing antibodies, as opposed to just binding antibodies, and neutralizing antibodies are antibodies that actually can block the virus,"" said fauci. the results were ""even better than we thought,"" he said, ""and they did it at a moderate dose of the vaccine.""  fauci said full results would be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal, most likely within a few weeks. if all goes according to plan, fauci said it is possible that a vaccine could be available within a matter of months a timeline that would shatter the years-long process typically required to produce a vaccine.  ""i think it is conceivable if we don't run into things that are, as they say, unanticipated setbacks, that we could have a vaccine that we could be beginning to deploy at the end of this calendar year, december 2020 or into january 2021,"" fauci said. [...]  until a vaccine is ready, public health experts agree that social distancing and other mitigation measures will remain central to keeping the outbreak at bay, particularly as states begin to reopen. fauci himself has warned of a second wave of cases, and said on friday that ""the one thing i'm sure of is that there will be infections around in the fall and in the winter, because it's not going to disappear from the planet.""  fauci said the test for government leaders will be how well prepared they are to keep ""blips of cases"" from growing into outbreaks, and from there, ""real rebounds of infection."" doing so will require ""identification, isolation and contact tracing,"" he said.  ""it isn't inevitable that we're going to have a massive rebound,"" said fauci. "" what is inevitable is that we will see cases. it's how we deal with it that's going to be the end game.""  fauci was also asked about an analysis released this week by researchers at columbia university which found that approximately 36,000 deaths could have been avoided in the united states had broad social distancing measures been put in place just one week earlier in march. the u.s. could have also seen roughly 700,000 fewer infections if actions that began on march 15 had instead started on march 8, according to the study.  ""we always could have done better, particularly when you look in the rearview mirror and do a retrospectoscope and say, 'wow, you know, we could have saved a lot of disease if we had done it much earlier.' and that's true,"" fauci said.

""relieve (a person or animal) of the symptoms of a disease or condition.""  but sure we'll call it ""preventing""   why not? deaths from a virus are deaths from a virus and one has killed way more in the last 20 years? it kills just as many or more than this little bug. it has a similar death rate and t it being able to reinfect is pure speculation, not even enough to form a hypothesis on, let alone prove and claim it. yes buy the differences is time and how big are the deaths each year. i should also point out that the flu in a single year now a days is pretty weak compare to the new virus now.  yes. it is how time works. which is why running and shouting in fear before the said time makes you cry wolf. you lose credibility which really isn't wise if you think it possible that there could be a danger. there is a sizable number that won't shelter again the next time because they keep lying. wmds, you are probably to young but the same fear mongering was used to kill hundreds of thousands. because that is what doomers do. you can't sit there on your ""updates"" high horse like your fear and panic and doomer retardation didn't have consequences. unemployment causes actual harm. people get stressed and that harms them. that ignores giving more power to government like the patriot act and nsa spying. secret arrests and extrajudicial or special interrogation techniques. fear is what drove germany a century ago. paris 250 years ago. mobs do terrible things and anger or fear drive them. both emotions.  updates prove that you should have had more skepticism, not less. it proves you should have waited and found the acorn first. that you should have cried wolf. ok doomer. how is crying wolf.  wow not only you right huge paragraphs for a small single quote, but you really dont have a counter argument for this. lmao      wow, that really hurt your feelings. son, i assumed and called out the assumption so you could correct me. what a douche you are acting for me giving you a branch. making it seem like you aren't worth it. alas, i have such hope that people can learn. one of my few faults. ;) not really , but it is funny. lol  what's wmd?

committee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions, we were simply told the world debt reset program will handle all of the details. &# x200b; several committee members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refused to participate in the world debt reset program, or the healthpass, or the vaccination schedule, and the answer we got was very troubling. essentially we were told it was our duty to make sure we came up with a plan to ensure that would never happen. we were told it was in the individuals best interest to participate. &# x200b; when several committee members pushed relentlessly to get an answer we were told that those who refused would first live under the lock down restrictions indefinitely. and that over a short period of time as more canadians transitioned into the debt forgiveness program, the ones who refused to participate would be deemed a public safety risk and would be relocated into isolation facilities. once in those facilities they would be given two options, participate in the debt forgiveness program and be released, or stay indefinitely in the isolation facility under the classification of a serious public health risk and have all their assets seized. &# x200b; so as you can imagine after hearing all of this it turned into quite the heated discussion and escalated beyond anything ive ever witnessed before. &# x200b; in the end it was implied by the pmo that the whole agenda will move forward no matter who agrees with it or not. &# x200b; that it wont just be canada but in fact all nations will have similar roadmaps and agendas. &# x200b; that we need to take advantage of the situations before us to promote change on a grander scale for the betterment of everyone. &# x200b; the members who were opposed and ones who brought up key issues that would arise from such a thing were completely ignored. our opinions and concerns were ignored. we were simply told to just do it. &# x200b; all i know is that i dont like it and i think its going to place canadians into a dark future.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,315,32,CovidVaccine

189,"so like many others in my field, ive been urging people, in as calm a tone as i can muster, to listen to experts and advising them about concrete steps they can take to keep their families, communities, and businesses safe.","sub statement: because the atlantic has a pay wall, i've reposted the entire article here. apologies and full credit to the author, but this is important for everyone to read.  --even with a robust government response to the novel coronavirus, many people will be in peril. and the united states is anything but prepared.-- --march 8, 2020-- --juliette kayyem, former department of homeland security official and author of security mom--  for the professionals who try to manage homeland-security threats, reassuring the public after a natural disaster or terrorist attackor amid a coronavirus outbreak like the one the world now facesis just part of the job. i am a former federal and state homeland-security official. i study safety and resiliency issues in an academic setting, advise companies on their emergency-response plans, and trade ideas with people in public health, law enforcement, and many other disciplines. since the beginning of the disease now known as covid-19, ive also been receiving more and more text messages from nervous relatives and friends. the rash decisions that panic breeds have never made any emergency better. so like many others in my field, ive been urging people, in as calm a tone as i can muster, to listen to experts and advising them about concrete steps they can take to keep their families, communities, and businesses safe. wash your hands. dont touch your face. avoid large gatherings. dont panic, and prepare as best you can. advice like mine is meant to be empowering, but now i fear it may also be misleading. if americans conclude that life will continue mostly as normal, they may be wrong. the united states is far less prepared than other democratic nations experiencing outbreaks of the novel coronavirus. low case counts so far may reflect not an absence of the pathogen but a woeful lack of testing.  disruptions are almost certain to multiply in the weeks to come. airlines are scaling back flights. conferences, including austins signature event, south by southwest, are being canceled. the drop in imports is hurting global supply chains. corporations are prohibiting their employees from traveling and attending mass gatherings. stanford university just canceled its in-person classes for the rest of the winter quarter, and other institutions are likely to take similar steps. government agencies and private companies alike will activate continuity-of-operations protocols, as they are called in my field. get used to it. aggressive steps are essential to protecting the public from a deadly virus. last week, the world health organization assessed the fatality rate at a shocking 3.4 percent, much higher than previously believed. early on, many american medical experts withheld judgment about the limited data coming out of china, but information from around the world has now confirmed how severe covid-19 is and how rapidly it is spreading. as dr. margaret bordeaux, my colleague at the security and global health project at harvards kennedy school, told me, none of us want to be chicken little, but there is too much consistent data to not begin to rattle the cage pretty loudly.  even if the united states were far more ready for covid-19, the consequences could still be grievous. in my field, adequate preparation means having the plans, money, equipment, and expertise in place to avert all but a tiny percentage of the harms that might otherwise occur. yet because of the nature of pandemics, even a level of preparation that looks robust to homeland-security experts could still fail to prevent thousands of deaths. i live in massachusetts. during the boston marathon bombing in 2013, three people died at the finish line, as two homemade bombs ripped through the crowd of spectators. it was a tragedy for their families and the people of boston. nearly 300 other people were injured. fortunately, the city has a large number of hospitals with excellent trauma centers and was therefore unusually well prepared for such an emergency. some people were treated on the scene; 127 othersmany of whom lost limbswere transported to local hospitals. not a single patient who survived the initial blast died. was this good news? unequivocally yes. the efforts of so many first responders and health professionals, and the public, saved those who might have otherwise died. but success is relative. that even careful preparations could still leave some people dead and others badly harmed is both a fact of life and appalling to accept. a threat as dire as the new coronavirus exposes the weaknesses in our society and our politics. if americans could seek testing and care without worrying about co-pays or surprise bills, and if everyone who showed symptoms had paid sick leave, the united states could more easily slow the spread of covid-19. but a crisis finds a nation as it is, not as its citizens wish it to be. the coronavirusand the measures enacted to stop itcould quickly change the rhythms of americans daily lives. the united states is seeing its first deaths, first emergency declarations, first school closings, first mandatory work-at-home policies. if the number of covid-19 cases spikes quickly, hospitals could soon be deluged with patients seeking care. this is a predictable consequence of any epidemic, but few americans personal experience gives them any reason to understand how disruptive these changes could be if the epidemic continues to worsen. ironically, the officials now urging citizens to keep calm understand far more acutely than the general public how much else can go wrong. a municipal police chief in the boston area recently urged me to imagine that a school district closed for even three weeks. take just one child, raised by a single parent who is a police officer. the child is home, so the parent must stay home. other officers in the same patrol will be affected even if they dont have kids in school. shifts will change, nonessential functions will be put off, and the department will have less flexibility to respond to problems unrelated to the epidemiceven as, with more teens unsupervised, rates of car accidents and certain crimes could well increase. emergency-response officials are hesitant to play out these dangers in public. this police chief asked me not to identify him because, like so many others in positions of responsibility, he worries that misgivings like his will become self-fulfilling propheciesthat citizens will panic if their local authorities give voice to their own doubts. meanwhile, president donald trump and his administration have vacillated between ignoring the threat and making wildly unrealistic promises about it. on wednesday, vice president mike pence promised 1.5 million coronavirus tests, but the atlantic reported friday that, according to all available evidence, fewer than 2,000 had been conducted in the united states. trump himself is simply lying about basic facts about the covid-19 response; despite the testing kit shortfall, he has publicly stated that everyone who wants to get tested can get tested. chinas aggressive containment of the new virus in the early weeks of this year gave other nations time to ready themselves for what was inevitably going to come: a shortage of test kits and personal protective equipment for a virus that spreads as quickly and causes as many deaths and hospitalizations as covid-19 does. the united states wasted that opportunity. trumps initial impulse to downplay the risk, at least until the stock market took note, wasnt just fanciful; it was dangerous. he has consistently minimized the number of sick, blamed barack obamas administration for a shortage of test kits, and publicly mused about the potential of a vaccine being found quickly. the american response to the new disease should be based on something more than hunches and magical thinking. the whole time, people like me have been dutifully advising friends, family, and everyone else to take prudent precautions and avoid panicking. thats still good advice, because any measures that slow the spread of the disease and lower the death rate could save thousands of lives. but americans should also understand that even the best preparation humanly possibly wouldnt be perfectand that what the united states has done so far falls far short of that. especially at this point, even a more vigorous response will not preclude a lot of people from getting sick. preventing all infections is no longer a possibility, and the measure of success is how much public-health authorities can reduce the number of people who die or fall seriously ill. --juliette kayyem, a former assistant secretary for homeland security under president obama, is the faculty chair of the homeland security program at harvards kennedy school of government. she is the author of security mom: an unclassified guide to protecting our homeland and your home.--",1,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,92437,48,CovidVaccine

""subjective superiority"" is a difficult topic. i saw a piece recently on how history is taught in the us, and they showed an interview where a guy says he doesn't care if his son learns factually wrong information, as long as it's the information that'll make him think his country is the best. "" over here"" it's turned into a running gag, saying the usa is no1.  in covid cases, in mass shootings, in lobbying, in incarceration, in anti-science movements....  wait they're saying the gays did now?? that's new.  yep. they made it because the vaccine will make people gay so they can make humanity die out because they hate everyone/christianity/families. alternative: it comes from homosexual sex, like aids (nope), or it's god's punishment.  bro our bridges and shit is literally falling on people's heads and we can't get monies to be moved from our massive military budget to stop our roads from crumbling apart.  i was mostly referring to electric car infrastructure (loading stations, energy supply, normed plugs, etc) but ok.  there was a study last year that 13% of german autobahn bridges are ""good"" or ""very good"", the rest needs repairs, refurbishment or replacement.  the problem is that there's a massive paper trail that takes time, you can't say ""this bridge is broken, lets fix it"". also, reopening a repaired bridge is less fun than cutting the ribbon on a fancy new airport (ever heard of the ber?). and some is just mismanaged (like spending millions to patch up a bridge to last another year before being torn down, rather than tearing it down now).  i guess i'm just like wahhhh bring the bug back, and i absolutely will not be satisfied until they do so, even though i likely will not get one.  the original bug was always a shell that bolts to a large base plate, so especially in the us you could technically take a beetle-shell and fill it with modern bits. like a subaru engine (b4 engine, same as the bug but modern). in germany the technology mostly focuses on period-based tuning, since engine swaps are nearly impossible to get approved. so some companies have gotten very good at squeezing power out of old engines. then again, the german aftermarket culture is kinda dead.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,40297,30,CovidVaccine

199,"the study, published online in the journal pediatrics, looked at more than 2,000 ill children across china, where the pandemic began."," the coronavirus raging around the globe has tended to tread gently with children, who account for the smallest percentage of the infections identified so far. now, the largest study to date of children and the virus has found that while most develop mild or moderate symptoms, a small percentage especially babies and preschoolers can become seriously ill. the study, published online in the journal pediatrics, looked at more than 2,000 ill children across china, where the pandemic began. it provides a clearer portrait of how the youngest patients are affected by the virus, knowledge that experts say can help influence policies like school closures, hospital preparedness and the deployment of an eventual treatment and vaccine.  the researchers analyzed 2,143 cases of children under 18 that were reported to the chinese centers for disease control and prevention as of feb. 8. just over a third of those cases were confirmed with laboratory testing. the rest were classified as suspected cases based on the childs symptoms, chest x-rays, blood tests and whether the child had been exposed to people with coronavirus. about half of the children had mild symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, cough, congestion and possibly nausea or diarrhea. more than a third about 39 percent became moderately sick, with additional symptoms including pneumonia or lung problems revealed by ct scan, but with no obvious shortness of breath. about 4 percent had no symptoms at all. but there were 125 children nearly 6 percent who developed very serious illness, and one 14-year-old boy with confirmed coronavirus infection died, said shilu tong, the studys senior author, who is director of the department of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics at shanghai childrens medical center. thirteen of those were considered critical,"" on the brink of respiratory or organ failure. the others were classified as severe because they had dire respiratory problems. effectively, what this tells us is that hospitals should prepare for some pediatric patients because we cant rule out children altogether, said dr. srinivas murthy, an associate professor of pediatrics at the university of british columbia, who was not involved in the study. the main conclusion, dr. murthy continued, is that children are infected at rates that may be comparable to adults, with severity thats much less, but that even within the kids, theres a spectrum of illness and theres a handful that require more aggressive therapy. more than 60 percent of the 125 children who became severely ill or critically ill were age 5 or younger, the study reported. forty of those were infants, under 12 months old. dr. tong said he believed that younger children were more susceptible to infection because their respiratory systems and other body functions are rapidly developing.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"0, news copy",94817,25,CovidVaccine

[in a 2015 speech, bill gates warned that the greatest risk to humanity was not nuclear war but an infectious virus that could threaten the lives of millions of people. that speech has resurfaced in recent weeks with 25 million new views on youtube but not in the way that mr. gates probably intended. anti-vaccinators, members of the conspiracy group qanon and right-wing pundits have instead seized on the video as evidence that one of the worlds richest men planned to use a pandemic to wrest control of the global health system. mr. gates, 64, the microsoft co-founder turned philanthropist, has now become the star of an explosion of conspiracy theories about the coronavirus outbreak. in posts on youtube, facebook and twitter, he is being falsely portrayed as the creator of covid-19, as a profiteer from a virus vaccine, and as part of a dastardly plot to use the illness to cull or surveil the global population. the wild claims have gained traction with conservative pundits like laura ingraham and anti-vaccinators such as robert f. kennedy jr. as mr. gates has emerged as a vocal counterweight to president trump on the coronavirus. for weeks, mr. gates has appeared on tv, on op-ed pages and in reddit forums calling for stay-at-home policies, expanded testing and vaccine development. and without naming mr. trump, he has criticized the presidents policies, including this weeks move to cut funding to the world health organization. misinformation about mr. gates is now the most widespread of all coronavirus falsehoods tracked by zignal labs, a media analysis company. the misinformation includes more than 16,000 posts on facebook this year about mr. gates and the virus that were liked and commented on nearly 900,000 times, according to a new york times analysis. on youtube, the 10 most popular videos spreading lies about mr. gates posted in march and april were viewed almost five million times. mr. gates, who is worth more than $100 billion, has effectively assumed the role occupied by george soros, the billionaire financier and democratic donor who has been a villain for the right. that makes mr. gates the latest individual along with dr. anthony fauci, the leading u.s. infectious disease expert to be ensnared in the flow of right-wing punditry that has denigrated those who appear at odds with mr. trump on the virus. bill gates is easily transformed into a health-related meme and figure because hes so well known, said whitney phillips, an assistant professor at syracuse university who teaches digital ethics. hes able to function as kind of an abstract boogeyman. especially since mr. gates has sharpened his comments about the white houses handling of the coronavirus in recent weeks. theres no question the united states missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel coronavirus, he wrote in an opinion column in the washington post on march 31. the choices we and our leaders make now will have an enormous impact on how soon case numbers start to go down, how long the economy remains shut down and how many americans will have to bury a loved one because of covid-19. mark suzman, chief executive of the bill & melinda gates foundation, mr. gatess main philanthropic vehicle, said it was distressing that there are people spreading misinformation when we should all be looking for ways to collaborate and save lives. through a representative, mr. gates declined to be interviewed. the conspiracy theories about mr. gates may particularly damage what people think about a future coronavirus vaccine, said claire wardle, executive director of first draft, an organization that fights online disinformation. she said the narratives have the potential to kick off coordinated and sophisticated online campaigns that turn people against taking a virus vaccine.]",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"0, news copy",82482,75,CovidVaccine

( timothy klausutis, who never remarried, still lives in the house he shared with his wife.) the autopsy conducted at the time of loris death confirmed that it was an accident; she had fainted as the result of a heart condition, hitting her head on a desk. theres not a thimble of evidence of foul play. but heres where things go from being tragic to being twisted. when lori klausutis died, she worked for thenrepublican representative joe scarborough. today, scarborough is a fierce critic of the president from his perch at msnbc, where he co-hosts morning joe. that is why the president has been peddling a cruel and baseless conspiracy theory that scarborough had klausutis murdered. this is a topic most journalists are inherently reluctant to cover, given the danger that it will draw more attention to a vile lie. but with the president and his son don jr., who between them have more than 85 million twitter followers, sending out lunatic tweets and calling for the opening of a cold case against psycho joe scarborough, human decency requires a response. that donald trump would resort to conspiracy theories to attack his perceived enemies is hardly a revelation. after all, trump employed a racist conspiracy theory against barack obama, which helped him gain political prominence in the republican party, and later claimed that president obama had wiretapped his phones. during the 2016 primary, trump linked ted cruzs father, rafael, to the assassination of president john f. kennedy and retweeted a supporter who claimed that marco rubio was ineligible to run because his parents were not natural-born u.s. citizens. trump suggested that the suicide of vince foster, a former aide to president bill clinton, and the death of former supreme court justice antonin scalia were murders; that childhood vaccines cause autism; and that windmills cause cancer. hes claimed that climate change is a total and very expensive hoax by chinas government, that a cybersecurity company framed russia for election interference, that ukraine was hiding hillary clintons missing emails, and that voter fraud cost him the popular vote in 2016. ( business insider provided a useful summary of more than two dozen of trumps conspiracy theories in october.) conspiracy theories have long been evidence of trumps twisted psychology. he has always traveled quite easily from the real world to the twilight zone, depending on which reality suits his needs at the moment. and when someone holds him accountablewhen someone calls him out for his incompetence and ethical wrongdoingconspiracy theories often become his weapon of choice. at such moments, conspiracy theories are fine, but conspiracy theories with the added element of cruelty are even better. which brings us back to the heartbreaking letter from timothy klausutis. donald trump doesnt merely want to criticize his opponents; he takes a depraved delight in inflicting pain on others, even if theres collateral damage in the process, as is the case with the klausutis family. theres something quite sick about it all. a lot of human casualties result from the cruelty of malignant narcissists like donald trumpcasualties, it should be said, that his supporters in the republican party, on various pro-trump websites and news outlets, and on talk radio are willing to tolerate or even defend. their philosophy seems to be that you need to break a few eggs to make an omelet. if putting up with trumps indecency is the price of maintaining power, so be it. will trumps white evangelical supportersfranklin graham jr., robert jeffress, eric metaxas, mike huckabee, ralph reeddefend his behavior as the perfect embodiment of the new testament ethic, the credo of jesus, the message from the sermon on the mount? blessed are the brutal, for they shall inherit the earth. some people will argue that trumps promotion of this conspiracy theory is just his latest distraction, a shiny object to pull our focus away from the human and economic cost of covid-19. maybe. but im not at all convinced that this will help trump politically. remember, trumps approval rating was often well under 50 percent even when the economy was doing well and america was at relative peace abroad. theres plenty of evidence, including the 2018 midterm elections, that trumps dehumanizing tactics erode his support, especially among white suburban women. and i rather doubt that people will have forgotten trumps reckless handling of the pandemic by november; defaming the memory of a woman who died nearly two decades ago and causing renewed grief for her family isnt likely to help him with most voters, either. but whatever the political ramifications of this current lie being promulgated by the president, the rest of us need to name it, and to make trump supporters own it. they are his, and he is theirs. in his letter to jack dorsey, timothy klausutis wrote that his wifes death, in 2001, was the single most painful thing that i have ever had to deal with in my 52 years and continues to haunt her parents and sister. he added: i have mourned my wife every day since her passing. i have tried to honor her memory and our marriage. as her husband, i feel that one of my marital obligations is to protect her memory as i would have protected her in life. there has been a constant barrage of falsehoods, half-truths, innuendo and conspiracy theories since the day she died. i realize that may sound like an exaggeration, unfortunately it is the verifiable truth. because of this, i have struggled to move forward with my life. and this: the frequency, intensity, ugliness, and promulgation of these horrifying lies ever increases on the internet. these conspiracy theorists, including most recently the president of the united states, continue to spread their bile and misinformation on your platform disparaging the memory of my wife and our marriage. near the end of his letter to dorsey, asking him to delete trumps tweetswhich dorsey has declined to doklausutis wrote: i would also ask that you consider loris niece and two nephews who will eventually come across this filth in the future. they have never met their aunt and it pains me to think they would ever have to learn about her this way. my wife deserves better. there is a wickedness in our president that long ago corrupted him. its corrupted his party. and its in the process of corrupting our country, too. he is a crimson stain on american decency. he needs to go.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"1, this is on its own storytelling but in the context of the whole comment, I'd select another span as storytelling and am also unsure if this is a news copy or not",71412,46,CovidVaccine

"" there is serious doubt that [recycling plastic] can ever be made viable on an economic basis,"" one industry insider wrote in a 1974 speech. yet the industry spent millions telling people to recycle, because, as one former top industry insider told npr, selling recycling sold plastic, even if it wasn't true.    here's the basic problem: all used plastic can be turned into new things, but picking it up, sorting it out and melting it down is expensive. plastic also degrades each time it is reused, meaning it can't be reused more than once or twice.   on the other hand, new plastic is cheap. it's made from oil and gas, and it's almost always less expensive and of better quality to just start fresh.   as it turns out, less than 10% of plastic haseverbeen recycled. #### ever.

these men (its always men) and confess your heart out. then they decide if youre repentant, what level you are repentant, and they decide your punishment. it can go from: this will be our little secret, to well weve got to rebuke you a little, or a lot, or to a full blow jehovah doesnt want you around disfellowshipping. disfellowship is when they kick you out and act like youre dead. jws will

curious to learn firsthand from people what they believe. was really fascinating hearing someone tell me that they could gladly die rather than be saved by a routine medical procedure. frankly, i think that's fine as long as kids can still be forced to receive it (i believe there is a court ruling saying that's true). if you're an adult, you can choose to die, just like i believe in assisted

readings. you know, standard stuff that was super annoying for kids to sit through.  but aside from that, a big group of them would meet up every friday to play walley-ball (volleyball, except inside a racquetball court, where you get to bounce the ball off of the walls, creating all kinds of insanely fun chaos.) i must have tagged along every week for 4 years and had a blast. thankfully, not once did they ever try to recruit me or interject anything religious into the activity. it was just a large group of parents and their kids (probably 20 people aged 14-50) getting together to play sports and eat at mcdonald's afterward.  one of the twins is married and not especially religious (i don't think). the other twin i think was sucked into the jws pretty deep. i sadly don't really keep in

228,"give me control of all major news outlets in the world, and venal mouthpieces like fauci to put on television day after day, and ill convince the population that pink panthers escaped from a zoo in the antarctic, and theyre roaming the globe spitting pink poison at billions of victims.","for months, ive been laying out evidence that: a new coronavirus was never properly discovered; the diagnostic tests are therefore meaningless; and most of the people who are sick are suffering from traditional illnesses which have been re-packaged under the empty umbrella label, covid. of course, most people in the world have a religious belief in the new virus. and that opens the door to: psychological covid. here is what it can look like. a person is watching tv for hours. hes treated to wall-to-wall news, ads, public service announcementsall about the virus and the pandemic. after days and weeks and months of this solid operant conditioning, hes in the covid frame of mind. hes in the context, the box, the pattern, the story line. he occasionally feels a bit of this and that: a scratchy throat, a sniffle. so he thinks, maybe this is the start of covid. one day, he has a headache. he thinks, didnt they say that could be a symptom, too? he takes his temperature. 99.8. he tries to rememberisnt my normal always a bit low? he calls his sister and asks her. she says, yes, you usually came up 98. why? whats the matter? nothing. i had a little cough yesterday, so i took my temperature. it was 99.8. call the doctor. ill be fine. you dont know that. call the doctor. after talking to his sister, his throat feels raw. he makes some tea. he putters around the apartment. he feels tired. for a second, a pain shoots up his arm. they said the virus could cause a heart problem. he goes to the fridge, takes out half a cake and eats a large slice. now he really feels tired, so he lies down and goes to sleep. when he wakes up, his nose is stuffed. he walks into the bathroom and blows his nose. he looks at himself in the mirror. his eyes are a little red. his face is pale. he coughs three times. he calls his doctor. a nurse says, well, you might have a few symptoms. you should come in and get tested. the next day he does. for two days, while hes waiting for the results, hes sneezing on and off. his head is stuffed. hes sleeping more than usual. his limbs ache a bit. is he feeling a chill, or is that a breeze blowing in through the screen? if you told him his thoughts and his mindset could be bringing on physical symptoms, he wouldnt believe you. every year for the past ten years, hes had at least one episode of cough-sneeze-slight fever, and hes thought nothing of itbut if you reminded him of that now, he wouldnt pay attention. no, this is different. he begins to feel fear. in that state of mild fear, he imagines going to the hospital and being put on a ventilator. he imagines infecting someone else and being found out. he imagines dying. the fear ratchets up. he sits in front of the tv, hoping to distract himself. but the commercials show people wearing masks. the next day, the phone rings. its the nurse. she tells him hes positive for covid. hes infected. hell need to isolate himself for two weeks, and if the symptoms become worse, he should go to emergency now his fever inches over 100. hes coughing more. getting the picture? if you dont think the mind and thoughts can affect the body, think again. if you dont think the ability to resist and shake off a concocted story-line is important, think again. if you dont think the refusal to accept official pronouncements is vital this person im describing, who has now been tagged with the covid label, is suffering from nothing. as in: nothing. hes adding up and making up his own story line, which puts him in a hole. if someone slapping him in the face could wake him up, someone should slap him in the face. hes just been suckered in, and hes suckering himself in. sir, you have psychological covid. it goes under a better name. suckers disease. oh but waitwhat about the people who are really sick? as i mentioned at the top, most of those people are suffering from traditional illnesses that have nothing to do with a new virus. give me control of all major news outlets in the world, and venal mouthpieces like fauci to put on television day after day, and ill convince the population that pink panthers escaped from a zoo in the antarctic, and theyre roaming the globe spitting pink poison at billions of victims. and whatever the symptoms of pink poisoning are supposed to be, people will begin to experience them. sir, youre not feeling pink poison symptoms. they dont exist. i saw three panthers this afternoon on my lawn. they were your cats. you might recall that your wife, who is divorcing you, had them at her apartment. she dropped them off in your yard early this morning. before some people jump to erroneous conclusions, let me state this yet again: yes, there are people in the world who are actually sick and dying, as always, and most of those who have been labeled covid are suffering from traditional diseases, such as pneumonia, tb, flu, other lung problems, etc. the remaining people who are labeled covidyou would have to look at these groups, wherever they live, to discover causes, such as: new toxic vaccine campaigns; new levels or new content of deadly pollution; pesticides; treatments with ventilators and toxic antiviral drugs, etc. no new virus required. mind control or psychological covid is its own creature, and it is widespread. if anyone thinks my use of the term suckers disease is too strong, and is unkind, and i should have called it something like befuddlement syndrome, let me point out that, in this situation, being nice and polite doesnt cut through the mind control. in fact, nice and polite, as they have spread across society like a moldy blanket, are main components of the reason why people are buying the virus story and the consequent lockdowns and economic destruction. they dont want to make waves. they want to be kinder and gentler toward authority. they want to cozy up to fascism and cooperate in their own downfall. george carlin laid it out 20 years ago: what we have now is a completely neurotic population where did this sudden fear of germs come from in this country? have you noticed this? the media, constantly running stories about all the latest infections salmonella, e-coli, hanta virus, bird flu and americans, they panic easily so now everybodys running around, scrubbing this and spraying that and overcooking their food and repeatedly washing their hands, trying to avoid all contact with germs. its ridiculous and it goes to ridiculous lengths bunch of goddamn pussies! besides, what do you think you have an immune system for? its for killing germs!let me tell you a true story about immunization okay? when i was a little boy in new york city in the 1940s, we swam in the hudson river and it was filled with raw sewage okay? we swam in raw sewage! you know to cool off! and at that time, the big fear was polio; thousands of kids died from polio every year but you know something? in my neighborhood, no one ever got polio! no one! ever! you know why? cause we swam in raw sewage! it strengthened our immune systems! the polio never had a prayer; we were tempered in raw shit! so personally, i never take any special precautions against germs. i dont shy away from people that sneeze and cough, i dont wipe off the telephone, i dont cover the toilet seat, and if i drop food on the floor, i pick it up and eat it! yes i do. even if im at a sidewalk caf! in calcutta! the poor section! on new years morning during a soccer riot! and you know something? in spite of all that so-called risky behavior, i never get infections, i dont get them, i dont get colds, i dont get flu, i dont get headaches, i dont get upset stomach, you know why? cause i got a good strong immune system and it gets a lot of practice a person suffering from self-induced psychological covid needs to take a sledgehammer to his own complicity and the propaganda of the state. crack the egg and climb out and breathe.",1,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"1, is this disclosure of harm, since it is a metaphor and the harm in question (disinformation) is not mentioned directly",45791,55,CovidVaccine
229,"if biden wins and he has a mask mandate as promised, its not going to go over well like it would have if the president would have mandated them in march/april/may.","i certainly respect your opinion and that you did your research on masks, but how do you reconcile the huge statistical difference in this study? its extremely obvious that masks in tandem with social distancing are hugely effective. 100%? no, of course not. but like you said yourself, non n95 masks helps to stop large particles, and combined with staying 6 feet away from people, the combo is as good as we can get until a vaccine is available (ok, n95 maybe better, but regular masks clearly help). there are photos available showing how far particles of all sizes spread through different materials, and common surgical masks do block out a ton compared to no mask. i dont believe everything i read or hear either, and things are often more complicated than what can be portrayed in a headline or short article. and what i do read, i consider the sources. a science journal is certainly different than say something on cnn or fox. and yes, there were conflicting messages with protesting not causing large outbreaks, while outdoor political rallies its spread more. but looking at that more in depth, the photos ive seen of both sides show a clear difference: protesters were wearing masks at a much higher level, probably 90%, compared to 10-20% at political rallies. and those rallies saw very little social distancing. so yes, there was and is a difference. i live in minnesota, and i was quite worried when the blm protests were going on that covid-19 would spread rapidly. thankfully, it didnt, so yes i give masks credit here. there is so much media spin on both sides, but more from one particular brand (cough fox cough), that other media sources by simply stating facts look biased by comparison. i think masks should have been mandated, and/or the message that the combo of masks and social distancing are extremely effective. we had dr. fauci doing that; we needed the president to do the same. mask mandate or not, we needed a jfk moment, ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. we needed to protect the elderly, the immunocompromised, those with pre-existing conditions. we needed to step up as a nation: we failed, miserably. masks are now a political statement. if biden wins and he has a mask mandate as promised, its not going to go over well like it would have if the president would have mandated them in march/april/may. or if not a mandate, at least promoting the hell out of them. were a selfish country, driven by political agendas, and it makes me sad.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,35798,37,CovidVaccine

""","january 24, 2020 with at least 800 cases confirmed worldwide, concerns over the latest coronavirus outbreak continue to escalate. researchers from china report on the epidemiological and radiological characteristics of the novel virus and clinical outcomes of the first set of infected individuals in two studies that were published january 24 in lancet. coronaviruses are rna viruses that are broadly distributed in humans and other mammals. though most coronavirus infections are mild, the new betacoronavirus (2019-ncov) appears to cause similar symptoms to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers). both sars and mers are known to trigger respiratory tract diseases and their outbreaks were collectively responsible for over a thousand deaths in the past two decades. in a new study, researchers from several institutions in china examined the first 41 patients confirmed to be infected with 2019-ncov and admitted to jin yin-tan hospital in wuhan between december 16, 2019 and january 2, 2020. they combined patient data from clinical records, laboratory tests, and ct exams in their assessment. the patients had a median age of 49, 66% had visited the huanan seafood market in wuhan, and more than two-thirds were otherwise healthy individuals. upon evaluating the data, the group found that the infected patients presented with a broad range of symptoms, including fever (98%), cough (76%), fatigue (44%), sputum production (28%), and diarrhea (3%). more than half of the patients developed shortness of breath roughly eight days from the onset of illness. "" despite sharing some similar symptoms to sars (e.g., fever, dry cough, shortness of breath), there are some important differences, such as the absence of upper respiratory tract symptoms (e.g., rhinorrhoea, sneezing, sore throat) and intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea,"" senior author dr. bin cao from capital medical university said in a statement. the imaging findings also revealed that all of the patients had abnormalities evident on their chest ct scans indicative of pneumonia, with 98% of the cases showing bilateral involvement. typical findings for patients transferred to the intensive care unit (icu) were bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation. for non-icu patients, the scans commonly showed bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation. furthermore, nearly 30% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. six patients in the cohort died shortly after hospital admission, five had acute cardiac injury, and four required ventilation. to prevent the 2019-ncov outbreak from becoming a pandemic, the situation needs to be carefully monitored and the virus must be deeply studied, the authors noted. reliable pathogen tests and differential diagnosis based on clinical description and imaging are crucial for clinicians during their first contact with suspected patients. person to person an associated study also published in the lancet, led by dr. kwok-yung yuen from the university of hong kong-shenzhen hospital, investigated the way the coronavirus disseminated among a family that visited wuhan from december 29, 2019 to january 4, 2020. of six family members who traveled to wuhan, five were confirmed to have 2019-ncov. none of them had visited the huanan seafood market, and a separate family member who did not travel to the region was also infected, suggesting that the coronavirus is capable of spreading from person to person. the most likely explanation for the family's infections is that one individual acquired the coronavirus while visiting a relative at the wuhan hospital, then later transmitted it to the rest of her family, the authors said. one of the infected individuals had no clinical symptoms of disease, indicating that asymptomatic infected individuals may continue to spread the virus unwittingly. "" because asymptomatic infection appears possible, controlling the epidemic will also rely on isolating patients, tracing and quarantining contacts as early as possible, educating the public on both food and personal hygiene, and ensuring healthcare workers comply with infection control,"" yuen said in a statement. all of the infected family members, except for the asymptomatic individual, presented with a combination of fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, and diarrhea three to six days after exposure. chest ct scans showed ground-glass opacities in all of the patients, with more extensive radiological changes seen on the scans of the older patients (more than 60 years old). the researchers have made publicly available the complete 2019-ncov genome, which they identified from two clinical samples. gaps in understanding 2019-ncov has also proved capable of remaining infectious in individuals through extended travel, with reports of the coronavirus having emerged in at least seven other countries. the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has confirmed two cases of coronavirus in the country among at least 63 patients currently under investigation. in a linked commentary, representatives from the chinese academy of medical sciences, chinese cdc, oxford university clinical research unit in vietnam, and university of virginia school of medicine underscored the importance of widespread awareness and improving current understanding of the coronavirus. "" to improve detection efficiency, front-line clinics, apart from local centers for disease control and prevention, should be armed with validated point-of-care diagnostic kits. .... education campaigns should be launched to promote precautions for travelers, including frequent hand-washing, cough etiquette, and use of personal protection equipment (e.g., masks) when visiting public places,"" they wrote. as there are no existing coronavirus antivirals or vaccines of proven efficacy in humans, a pressing need remains to develop best supportive care and a vaccine, they concluded.

237,"such experiments, like this study by duprex, involved the genetic engineering of three viral pathogen strains and then seeing which would become most transmissible and virulent in an animal host.","paul duprex: darpa-funded researcher and gain-of-function enthusiast paul duprex is a former chief scientist for johnson & johnson whose subsequent foray into academia was largely funded with research grants from the nih and the pentagons defense advanced research projects agency (darpa). much of duprexs research has focused on recombinant (i. e., genetically engineered) viruses or viral evolution. in terms of his research funded by darpa, duprex was most closely associated with darpas prophecy program, the creation of which was overseen by michael callahan. callahans suspect past and his ties to the origin of the current covid-19 crisis in wuhan, china, were the subject of a recent unlimited hangout article by raul diego. in that article, diego notes that the now-defunct prophecy program had sought to transform the vaccine and drug development enterprise from observational and reactive to predictive and preemptive through algorithmic programming techniques and that the program further proposed that viral mutations and outbreaks could be predicted in advance to more rapidly counter the unknown disease with preemptive drug and vaccine development.  by all indications, prophecy was darpas first major foray into predictive ai-powered health care, which has expanded considerably in the years since. it also involved a component, which duprex was particularly involved in advancing, whereby the predictive viral evolutions algorithms would be validated and tested . . . by using multiple selective pressures on at least three closely related virus strains in an experimental setting.  such experiments, like this study by duprex, involved the genetic engineering of three viral pathogen strains and then seeing which would become most transmissible and virulent in an animal host. such studies are often referred to as gain-of-function (gof) research and are incredibly controversial given that they often create pathogens that are more virulent and/or transmissible than they otherwise would be. it is also worth noting that upmc, before duprex joined the center, had also received millions in funding from darpas prophecy program to develop in vitro and computational models for predicting viral evolution under selection pressure from multiple evolutionary stressors. duprex has also been involved in conducting research for darpas current interfering and co-evolving prevention and therapy (intercept) program, a successor to prophecy that aims to harness viral evolution to create a novel, adaptive form of medical countermeasuretherapeutic interfering particles (tips)that outcompetes viruses in the body to prevent or treat infection. tips are genetically engineered viruses with defective genomes that theoretically compete with real viruses for viral components in the human body but evolve with the viruses they are meant to protect the body against and are susceptible to mutation over time.  the goal of the intercept program is to use tips as therapeutics and have them injected into the human body to preemptively protect against the virus from which a particular tip was developed. it is worth noting that, while darpa frames much of its gene-editing research (including its genetic extinction technology research) as being aimed at promoting either human or environmental health, it has also openly admitted that these same technologies are of interest to darpa for their ability to subvert the genes of human adversaries of the us military via genetic weapons. duprex led an intercept study published in february of this year in which he and his coauthors explored how to create a synthetic tip of the nipah virus, a deadly virus with a fatality rate of over 70 percent. in that study, they used both wild and genetically engineered strains of nipah virus. notably, the clade x pandemic simulation, which will be discussed in detail in the next installment of this series, involved a genetically engineered combination of the nipah virus and a parainfluenza disease.  clade x took place in 2018 and was led by much of the same team that was responsible for the 2001 dark winter bioterrorism simulation, including former fda commissioner margaret hamburg and tara otoole and thomas inglesby of the upmc center for biosecurity. another notable participant at clade x was julie gerberding, former cdc director and current executive vice president at merck, which has close ties to upmc as well as the center for biosecuritys failed 21st century biodefense project. a few months after publishing the study funded by darpas intercept program, duprex coauthored another study on the use of synthetic nanobodies (i. e., bioengineered synthetic nanoparticles acting as antibodies) that was published in august. this effort mirrors other darpa health-focused projects. that study was funded by the university of pittsburgh, the nih, and israels ministry of science and technology. in addition to his ties to darpa programs involving the genetic engineering of viral pathogens, duprex is a leading advocate for controversial gain-of-function research and was appointed to direct upmcs center for vaccine research less than three months after the federal moratorium on gof research ended.  in october 2014, five days after that moratorium was first imposed, duprex gave a talk to the national science advisory board for biosecurity entitled gain-of-function studies: their history, their utility, and what they can tell us. in the talk, he asserted that cross-species infection studies have already helped to improve surveillance in the field, have shed new light on basic influenza virus biology, and could assist in growing vaccine viruses better and argues against the recently imposed moratorium. in 2014, duprex also wrote in a paper published in nature that gof approaches are absolutely essential in infectious disease research; although alternative approaches can be very useful, these can never replace gof experiments. he added that, in his view, there were only two reasons for gof research, the first being to improve surveillance or to develop therapeutics and the second being merely to learn interesting biology.  in that same paper, he also argued that genetic engineering that is intended and likely to endow a low-pathogenicity, low-transmissibility agent with either enhanced pathogenicity or enhanced transmissibility may be appropriate if the benefits are substantial. he also suggested in this 2014 paper that it might be necessary to enhance pathogenicity of coronaviruses in order to develop a valid animal model for coronaviruses. years later, during the current coronavirus crisis, duprex and other officials from the upmcs center for vaccine research co-developed a covid-19 research and development blueprint for the uns world health organization. in addition, duprexs work for darpas prophecy program involved gof research, as noted above, and the creator of that program, michael callahan former head of darpas biodefense therapeutics initiatives, is also a proponent of gof who believes that such risky research is inseparable from the research and development enterprise in the life sciences and for biotechnology. duprex is also a founding member of scientists for science, a group of researchers (most of whom are involved in gof research) who opposed the gof moratorium and were confident that biomedical research on potentially dangerous pathogens can be performed safely and is essential for a comprehensive understanding of microbial disease pathogenesis, prevention and treatment. another of the groups founding members is yoshihiro kawaoka, whose controversial gof experiments that made pathogenic viruses more deadly have garnered considerablemedia attention. when the moratorium on gof was lifted in december 2017, duprex called it a sign of progress, adding that on a personal level im really pleased these nih funded scientists [conducting gof research] get some clarity. as previously mentioned, he became the center for vaccine researchs director less than three months later, in march

238,"however as autopsies have shown which were carried out in germany, in particular by the forensic scientist professor klaus puschel in hamburg, the fatalities he examined had almost all been caused by serious pre-existing conditions and almost all of the people who had died had died at the very at a very old age, just like in italy, meaning they had lived beyond their average life expectancy. in this context the following should also be mentioned the german rki that is, again, the equivalent of the cdc, had initially strangely enough recommended that no autopsies be 	performed and there are numerous credible reports that doctors and 	hospitals worldwide had been paid money for declaring a deceased person a victim of covid19 rather than writing down the true cause of death on the death certificate, for example a heart attack or a 	gunshot wound. without the autopsies we would never know that the 	 overwhelming majority of the alleged covid19 victims had died of completely different diseases but not of covid19.  the assertion that the lock-down was necessary because there were so many differentinfections with sars cov2 and because the healthcare systems would be overwhelmed is wrong for three reasons as we have learned from the hearings we (20:01) conducted with the corona committee and from 	 other data that has become available in the meantime: a)  the lock-down was imposed when the virus was already retreating by the time the lock-down was imposed the alleged infection rates were already dropping again;  b) there's already protection from the virus because of cross or t - cell immunity.","part 1b fast forward to march of 2020 when the german bundestag announced an epidemic situation of national importance, which is the german equivalent of a pandemic, in 	march of 2020, and based on this the lock-down with the suspension of all essential constitutional rights for an unforeseeable time. there was only one single opinion on which the federal government in 	germany based its decision. in an outrageous violation of the 	universally accepted principle audiator at ultra parse, which means that one must also hear the other side, the only person they 	listened to was mr. drosten.  that is the very person whose 	horrific panic-inducing prognosis had proved to be catastrophically false 12 years earlier.  we know this because a whistle-blower named david silva (sp?), a member of the green party, told us about it. 	he did so first on august 29, 2020 in berlin in the context of an event at which robert f kennedy jr. also took part and at which both men gave speeches and he did so afterwards in one of the sessions of our corona committee. the reason he did this is that he had become 	increasingly skeptical about the the official narrative propagated by politicians and the mainstream media. he had therefore undertaken an effort to find out about other scientists opinions and had found them on the internet. there he realized that there were a number of highly renowned scientists who held a completely 	different opinion which contradicted the horrific prognosis of mr. 	drosten. they assumed, and still do assume, that there was no disease that went beyond the gravity of the seasonal flu, that the population had already acquired cross or t-cell immunity against 	this allegedly new virus and that there was therefore no reason for any special measures and certainly not for vaccinations. these 	scientists include: professor john ioannidis of stanford 	university in california, a specialist in statistics and epidemiology as well as public health; and at the same time the most 	quoted scientists in the world: professor michael levitt, nobel prize winner for chemistry, (and uh) and also a biophysicist at stanford university; the german professors karin molling; sucharit 	bhakdi; knut wittkowski; as well as stefan homburg;  and now many many 	more scientists and doctors worldwide, including dr. mike yeadon.  dr. mike yeadon is the former vice-president and scientific director 	of pfizer, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. i will talk some more about him a little later.  at the end of 	march, beginning of april, of 2020, mr. sieber turned to the leadership of his green party with the (uh) knowledge he had 	 accumulated and suggested that they present these other scientific opinions to the public and explain that contrary to mr. drosten's 	 doomsday prophecies there was no reason for the public to panic.  incidentally lord assumption, who served as a judge at the british supreme court from 2012 to 2018 (had the) had done the very same 	thing at the very same time and had come to the very same conclusion 	that there was no factual basis for panic and no legal basis for the corona  	measures. likewise the former president of the german federal constitutional court 	expressed, albeit more cautiously, serious doubts, that the corona measures were constitutional. but instead of taking note of these 	other opinions and discussing them with david sieber the green party 	leadership declared that mr. drosten's panic messages were good enough for the german party, uh for the green 	party. remember they're not a member of the ruling coalition, they're the opposition, still that was enough for them just as it had been good enough for the federal 	government as a basis for its lock-down decision. they said... they subsequently... the green party leadership called david sieber a conspiracy theorist without ever having 	considered the content of his information and then stripped him of his mandates.  now let's take a look at the current actual situation regarding the virus's danger, the complete uselessness of pcr tests for the detection of 	 infections, and the lock-downs based on non-existent infections. 	in the meantime we know that the health care systems were never in danger of becoming overwhelmed by covid19.  on the contrary many 	hospitals remain empty to this day and some are now facing 	bankruptcy. the hospital ship comfort which anchored in new york at the time and could have accommodated a thousand patients never accommodated more than some 20 patients. nowhere was there any 	excess mortality. studies carried out by professor juanitas and others have shown that the mortality of corona is equivalent to that of the seasonal flu. even the pictures from bergamo or new york 	that were used to demonstrate to the world that panic was in order proved to be deliberately misleading. then the so-called panic paper was leaked which was written by the german department of the interior. its classified content shows beyond a  shadow of a doubt that in fact the population was deliberately driven to panic by politicians and mainstream media.  the accompanying irresponsible statements of the head of the rki(remember the cdc) 	mr. weiler, who repeatedly and excitedly announced that the corona measures must be followed unconditionally by the population without 	them asking any question shows that that he followed the script verbatim in his public statements. he kept announcing that the 	situation was very grave and threatening although the figures compiled by his own institute  proved the exact 	opposite. among other things the panic paper calls for children to be made to feel 	responsible and i quote for the painful, tortured death of their parents and grandparents if they do not follow the corona rules that is, if they do not wash their hands constantly, and don't stay 	away from their grandparents.  	a word of clarification, in bergamo, the vast majority of deaths, 94 to be exact, turned out to be the result, not of covid19, but rather the 	 consequence of the government deciding to transfer sick patients, 	sick with probably the cold or seasonal flu, from hospitals to nursing homes in order to make room at the hospitals for all the covid patients who ultimately never arrived. there, at the nursing homes, they then infected old people with a severely weakened immune 	system usually as a result of pre-existing medical conditions. in 	addition a flu vaccination which had previously been been administered had further weakened the immune systems of the people 	in the nursing homes. in new york, only some but by far not all, 	hospitals were overwhelmed.  many people, most of whom were again elderly and had serious pre-existing medical conditions, and most of whom had it not been for the panic mongering would have just stayed at home to recover raced to the hospitals. there many of 	them fell victim to healthcare-associated infections or nosocomial infections on the one hand and incidents of malpractice on the other hand, for example by being put on a respirator rather than receiving 	oxygen through an oxygen mask. again to clarify covid19, this is the current state of affairs, is a dangerous disease just like the seasonal flu is a dangerous disease and of course covid19, just like the seasonal flu, may sometimes take 	severe clinic... take a severe clinical course and will sometimes kill patients. however as autopsies have shown which were carried out in germany, in particular by the forensic scientist professor klaus puschel in hamburg, the fatalities he examined had almost all been caused by serious pre-existing conditions and almost all of the people who had died had died at the very at a very old age, just like in italy, meaning they had lived beyond their average life expectancy. in this context the following should also

and 	hospitals worldwide had been paid money for declaring a deceased person a victim of covid19 rather than writing down the true cause of death on the death certificate, for example a heart attack or a 	gunshot wound. without the autopsies we would never know that the 	 overwhelming majority of the alleged covid19 victims had died of completely different diseases but not of covid19.  the assertion that the lock-down was necessary because there were so many differentinfections with sars cov2 and because the healthcare systems would be overwhelmed is wrong for three reasons as we have learned from the hearings we (20:01) conducted with the corona committee and from 	 other data that has become available in the meantime: a)  the lock-down was imposed when the virus was already retreating by the time the lock-down was imposed the alleged infection rates were already dropping again;  b) there's already protection from the virus because of cross or t - cell

240,the federal government awarded a $371-million contract to secure personal protective equipment one of the largestmedical supply deals in itshistory to a small company headquartered in a house in suburban ottawa that had no apparent prior experience in ppe procurement.,"this story is part of [the big spend](https://www.cbc.ca/news/topic/tag/the%20big%20spend), a cbc news investigation examining the unprecedented $240 billion the federal government handed out during the first eight months of the pandemic. the federal government awarded a $371-million contract to secure personal protective equipment one of the largestmedical supply deals in itshistory to a small company headquartered in a house in suburban ottawa that had no apparent prior experience in ppe procurement.   proline advantage inc. 's tender submission was one of more than 26,000 received by the government through its [buyandsell.gc.ca](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/jmr-c89xxfjxk8asnshtd?domain=buyandsell.gc.ca)portal after it put out a call to suppliers last march for help procuring ppe.   of those thousands of submissions, a number of lucrative contracts went to low-profile companies that pivoted to the ppe market, seeing opportunity in the mad dash to secure supplies in the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic.   in the case of proline advantage inc., the government says the company delivered the goods and fulfilled the obligations of itscontract by august, coincidentally the same month proline's ppe procurement website went live.   ""our company is experienced in supply chain management and has a proud track record of sourcing products of various types from around the world,"" caron wrote.   ""like many firms, we were able to quickly pivot our business, and leverage our international sourcing expertise to answer the government's call and address the immediate and pressing need to provide ppe to front-line medical professionals.""   in total, the federal government has spent just over $6.1 billion on what it describes as ""[a broad range of equipment and supplies from domestic and international suppliers to combat covid-19,](https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/comm/aic-scr/contrats-contracts-eng.html)"" not including vaccines.   \---   mehrotra said the government had to act quickly because other countries would be chasing the same ppe supplies andthere was concern the world would be cut off from ppe manufacturers, most of which are based in china.   ""the purpose was to make sure that in case we get shut off from the global supply chain, we still have our own equipment to deal with the crisis,"" said mehrotra.   in that sense, he said, the $6-billion government ppe procurement operation was an overwhelming success, regardless of who filled the orders. ## more stories in this series:  [interactiveottawa has spent $240b fighting covid-19. here's where the money went](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/thebigspend/) [the big spendwhy millions of dollars in pandemic aid is going to corporations making healthy profits](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/cews-wage-subsidy-jobs-covid-1.5834790) [the big spenddistillers scrambled to make hand sanitizer for free. then the federal government moved on](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/distillers-hand-sanitizer-pandemic-1.5813509) [the big spendas passengers pushed for refunds, air canada got more than $400 million for wage subsidy](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/air-canada-492-million-in-wage-subsidy-covid-19-1.5824950) [government calls on private sector to come up with compostable, recyclable pandemic gear](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ppe-waste-business-challenge-1.5765902) [the great ppe panic: how the pandemic caught canada with its stockpiles down](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ppe-pandemic-covid-coronavirus-masks-1.5645120) [read all of cbc's big spend coverage](https://www.cbc.ca/news/topic/tag/the%20big%20spend)",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"0, news copy",2810,44,CovidVaccine

In anticipation of charitable handouts, Vietnam was worse prepared for the current outbreak.","For context, I was born in a developed country (Canada) but I have lived in a developing country (Vietnam) for almost four years. I still currently reside in Vietnam, however I will be moving back to Canada in about a week. I have a strong bond with both countries. 
Saying that... I agree with your idea in part. The developing nations in SE Asia are really struggling with the Delta variant due to low vaccination rates. The virus is spreading like crazy. Vietnam historically has managed the virus quite well. However, the Delta variant has proven near uncontrollable and a significant number of vaccines being shipped into the country could really help with that. Now, do I think America should give up their booster vaccinations and prioritize Vietnam? No. There are a few reasons why:
1) Vietnam was overconfident with their ability to manage the virus. This is because for the first year of COVID, lockdowns were uncommon and short lived. As a result of this, the vaccination rates in Vietnam are the lowest in SE Asia. However, Vietnam is not the poorest country in SE Asia. While it hasn't been explicitly stated by the media/politicians, it is likely Vietnam was trying to wait until the vaccine was lower in demand/price (or even free) to secure it for their population. In anticipation of charitable handouts, Vietnam was worse prepared for the current outbreak. 
2) America is a complex case for managing COVID. Due to personal freedoms and a divisive political atmosphere, COVID has never been fully controlled. As such, those who are vaccinated are almost exclusively relying on the protection of their vaccinations as there are few other social controls to protect them. 
3) Vietnam (as an authoritarian nation with a collectivist population) is better prepared to manage outbreaks than America. The people in the country accept mask use, rationing grocery store visits, deliveries, curfews, lockdowns, and staying at home. In addition, since most people live in multigenerational homes, people will (for the most part) get by without an income stream for a significant period of time. Americans on the other hand typically live away from family and have few reliable welfare systems in place to support them in a crisis. 
4) Americans still need to prioritize 1st and 2nd doses in America too. This means they need to maintain stock in their pharmacies. However, vaccines have an expiration date, and once shipped to a pharmacy they can't be shipped again to another country. It is likely that a good number of booster shots are going to come from stock that was going to expire anyway.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"0, again a personal account with the personal aspect and established background outside of the span",h9ft6wp,57,CMV

In these cases, I tip, because I want the business to survive and I have a steady income (fortune 500 company  job).","There's two aspects of Tipping.  Financial and social.  For the financial side of things, I'm almost in agreement with you.  People should not be reliant on tips for their income, but tips should be an enhancement.  In which most service type Jobs, Tips should be treated like bonuses. 
For the social, Tipping is a sign of gratitude.  At Restaurants you tip based on how well you feel served.  Hair salons, based on your experience and how well you enjoy your new haircut. But it is more than the act.  You are thanking the person with financial means.  But in a covid world, financial means are dying for many, many businesses.  In my area, most business are either operating at a loss in hopes of sustaining till post vacinne or it is more of a hobby ownership, and not primary means of income.  In these cases, I tip, because I want the business to survive and I have a steady income (fortune 500 company  job).  
But lets examine the social aspect.  A tip is a means of thanks and gratitude.  Did you have questions for the barista?  Did they go above and beyond the ""take money hand goods."" Baristas actually do a fantastic job for these things a lot of the times. Sometimes they do some foam art, or little drawings on names.  Or a casual conversation, to which I personally appreciate.  These things enhance and make my day, so in return I want to enhance and make their day.  Take the donuts shop.  At a lot of donut shops the register is also the one making the donuts, and are there for hours before anyone is buying donuts.  I can recognize this and give a tip saying, yeah your selling this donuts for $1, but i think you deserve more.  
Or take the froyo shop.  I find often these jobs are being handled by high school or college students.  They are not making much.  I know I can afford to help them on their journey to independence, but not everyone can.  I also know it is better for the store to keep prices low and costs low, more people are willing to get froyo then.  Therefore I am lucky and able to tip, but a family of 4 who only have the flexibility to go out for major events, can take their son out to froyo for their birthday. 
Tipping allows for more exchange of finances to more people, and people to pay what their wish, as opposed to what is asked.  Its the inverse of bartering.  In which more people are able to get the goods, because some are willing to pay more.   I personally wish non-mandated tipping was more common, so I can give the workers more money, and just pay the business the costs.

I know a lot of people in government, especially in Germany (I am German) - and like everyone else, they had little clue what to do and just looked at what others do. 
I wouldn't say that.  Sure, you didn't get a vaccine early.  But you got something better: mass testing.  The US has the most PCR machines/capacity per capita of any country, but they all sat idle.  The FDA required that only FDA approved tests be used, and didn't even approve the CDC test as it was missing an (easily replaceable) component.  We couldn't do any significant testing until April 2020, and even then it took weeks to process many samples.  Attempts like a Seattle flu lab's to process flu samples to check for Covid to monitor early spread resulted in a government shutdown of the project/firing the people who took that initiative. 
Meanwhile you had your Covid labs working by the end of January.  Even today, you have been using home tests for quite a while (many invented/manufactured in the US) that we simply haven't gotten approved. 
Testing is the key, vaccines only go so far.  Yet was Germany able to saunter through the pandemic unscathed?  Nah, just done a bit better than the US. 
Countries that vaccinated earliest, countries that have high rates of vaccination - it's not enough. 
All the things that a fully Libertarian country could have done better - way better testing, a bit better vaccination - just don't seem to have done an amazing job for the countries that went better in that direction.

264,"&gt; Second, the protests themselves also dramatically increased social distancing/quarantining behavior in the general public, as in nobody wanted to be downtown during the protests and businesses that might otherwise be open and drawing customers were shut down.","&gt;If you look up studies on it, they found that there were a couple reasons the BLM protests didn't result in significant increases of cases of covid-19 (in many cases none at all).  First, as you pointed out, BLM protesters were more likely to wear masks, social distance, and enforce that behavior in other protestors.  That does a ton to reduce spread.  BLM protestors were also more likely to quarantine after protests. 
Could you point me to such a study? 
What I looked at the pictures in media, there was reasonable mask wearing (not universal, though) but other social distancing measures were pretty much non-existent. The protesters were shoulder to shoulder. Furthermore, the protests always include shouting, which is a great way to spread the droplets. 
I've never heard of that voluntary quarantining by the protesters after the protests, so any pointer to the source of that claim would great. 
&gt; Second, the protests themselves also dramatically increased social distancing/quarantining behavior in the general public, as in nobody wanted to be downtown during the protests and businesses that might otherwise be open and drawing customers were shut down. 
Ok, this could contribute, but only if the people who would have been going to downtown would not have exercised social distancing and/or worn masks. I mean, it's a bit different thing that someone goes to a supermarket, wears a mask, doesn't talk to anyone and leaves the shop than if someone goes to a demonstration, is close proximity with other people for hours and keeps talking and shouting throughout even though the absolute numbers of people outside their homes in both cases are the same. 
&gt; Third, Trump's base skews elderly, especially when compared to BLM protesters. They are more likely to catch the virus and experience significant symptoms.

But he didn't die from asphyxiation, he died from heart attack which started from the panic attack when the police first approached him because he had speedball in his system. 
&gt;&gt; I agree, but what if you punch the cops, and try to steal their weapons, and shoot tasers at them
&gt; At that point, if they can be apprehended safely, they should go to jail. I don't think that any of these things generally get a death sentence in a court of law, so if they are currently unarmed and not an immediate deadly threat they should not be killed extra-judiciously. 
So if the suspect who is physically stronger tries to fight the cop for the gun, the cop shouldn't use his weapon? Should just let the criminal do whatever he wants when he gets the weapon? 
&gt; Sure, it also comes from connection to the perpetrator, and fear of reprisal. Distrust of the cops is one factor in many, but it is still a pertinent factor. Two things can be true at the same time. 
Yes, the main factor is culture, which is enhanced by the media/narrrative.

&gt; I think many people would argue that this is more reason to not put a person in a position where they can't breath. I have asthma. If I were having an asthma attack and someone put me in that position I would likely die. I would not die if I could get into a position where it was easier to breath. Does that mean that my asthma is what killed me and it is no fault of the person who put me in that position? 
That makes sense, but having asthma doesn't give you liberty to not follow police instructions, if you do, you will be restrained that may increase your chance of dying. That's like intentionally walking into a smoking bar, dying and then blaming it on the owners. 
&gt; What exactly is this left? You say it like there is some sort of hegemony ruling over some sect of the country.

If there are individual bad actors, call them out and work towards making it so they cannot do their unethical actions. Even if there were some horrible conspiracy, keeping it vague would not help remove it. 
It is a hegemon when considering election official in power, they want to divide, paint narrative, destabilize, etc

Progressive and liberal are mutually exclusive. Progressive is group identity first, liberal is individual first. 
&gt; I don't find it surprising that a news media outlet would portray this and every story in the most gripping manner possible in order to get more attention.

I understand the hesitation. I understand the terrible track record of some of the pharmaceutical companies, and many dropped balls among other stakeholders, including governments.

the discussions that form the core of progressivism was.  even earlier to be frank; I referenced the first exports with respect to revolutions within modern societies (starting in the backrooms of europe).  capitalism to my mind, is a completely failed theory, akin to marxists saying marxism would work... if only people would change. ;) 
&gt; oh and alcohol kills brain cells too
&gt; Have you ever seen a child with lead poisoning? I'll assume you haven't, if you're comparing it to alcohol. 
have you ever seen a chronic alcoholic :) the fact that you consume alcohol mostly when young and thus, don't feel the loss, does not mean it does not occur.  though I will grant that various forms of metal poisoning are nasty. 
&gt; Let me tell you this: there's no recreational drug as ugly as a heavy metal sloshing around the brain. Since it can't be excreted, the lead will kill you, but first it'll reduce you to a drooling, soulless pile of flesh on the floor. 
habitual use of nitrous oxide (and other inhalants).  turns your brain to swiss cheese. literally. 
&gt; I think the vaccines are worse. cause you don't know -what its doing-
&gt; I know exactly what vaccines do, because I studied immunology. It's honestly not that complicated or mysterious, and I've no clue why conspiracy theorists latched onto vaccines in particular. 
vaccines = the recent versions (mrna-based expression of proteins, + the adenovirus delivery systems in others).  I haven't looked at the lipid delivery system yet for moderna's, but its in a similar field I have an interest in (surfactant chemistry/emulsions).  I have many interests. 
&gt; It's honestly not that complicated or mysterious
when people say shit like that, it worries me.  prior to the various forms of 'complications', everyone was like its completely harmless. NO.  for a variety of reasons.  but try having a reasonable discussion with people and they flip out.  
&gt; Yet I am sad to hear you repeat these lies. 
they aren't lies.  I have a reasonable basis for my suspicions.  and I made them way before anyone else did, and I might add, when it wasn't just high unpopular, but a lynching offense. Vaccines formulations in particular, have a particularly long delay/effect, much less new vaccine technologies.  the central dogma for molecular biology is already in question, and has already been demonstrated to be violated specifically with respect to covid vaccine (paper around three months back).  and thats not even mentioning the possible auto-immune, epigenetic effects or conserved genetic damage (cross-generational). 
&gt; I imagine you're doing so with the best intentions, because, in truth, someone lied to you. You're the victim here, and if I were you, that would piss me off. 
no sir.  you mistake me for another person. :)  
&gt; I think that the world is already confusing and difficult enough for us to understand without all these harmful lies, right? 
I do not find the world confusing or difficult to understand.

The Mueller Report states as much. I'm sorry you are so resistant to reality. 
You've not read the report, I'm sure. There was ample evidence his organization colluded with Russia, but he couldn't tie it to the president without the ability to indict. Mueller stated very clearly that the only reason he wasn't indicting Trump for obstruction of justice was that the DOJ wouldn't indict a sitting president. Watch this space. 
On the other hand, 42 legal challenges to the election, many of them before conservative judges and one to his hand-picked supreme court. All thrown out for being groundless. Every recount performed as requested under intense scrutiny from hostile partisan observers. None of them changed the tally. 
But this is evidence, so I won't waste your time with it any futher. 
I'm unaware of any genocide Clinton ignored. He bombed Serbia to stop one. 
As of today, Paraguay has 18,122 cases per 1million. The US has 78,720. Paraguay shares borders with Brazil and Argentina where it is rampant. It's not luck. They followed the science and they've done much better than most. The only nations who have done worse than the US under the buffoon you are arguing for are Lux, Czechia, San Marino, Montenegro, Gibraltar and Andorra. 
~ Sure fat cats did well under Clinton. But he didn't gift them a trillion dollar tax cut and then another trillion in un-monitored covid relief that was supposed to got to small businesses. That's some pretty nice grift, right there; NO president compares. 
~ Give me a list of the left-wing insurgencies that have happened since the end of the Second World War. Do you have a clue about the conditions in which they occur? NONE of them have overthrown functional democracies. They have all been attempts to topple failed-state, strongman fascist or neofascist governments. Right wing insurgencies almost always happen in liberal democracies that try to get their wealthy citizens to pay their fair share of taxes.

If you're going to do that you can keep it to yourself. 
&gt;Yes, and Jeffrey Epstein definitely killed himself too. 
Interesting you should mention this little bit of Q lore. So Epstein was murdered in his cell, you say?

As far as using military force to stop peaceful protesters; that didn't happen. He used the military force against rioters and looters and hostile people when the local government would not do anything.  The key words in the 1A is PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY.  Throwing objects at people, shouting directly into people's faces, disrupting the flow of traffic, looting, rioting, and murder is NOT a peaceful assembly. So yes because of these violent acts he sent in the NG in the areas where they were needed and he had every right to. He passed an executive order to get the social media platforms to stop banning and uphold the 1A for all sides. Right now only conservative speech is being banned on these platforms. Since day one trump has been attacked. Maxine waters of the democrat party said that she will impeach him; since day one.  It was his first day, nothing but being sworn in and speeches goes on that day. How can a political party vow to impeach a president when he has not been in office to commit impeachable crimes? And three years later, millions of tax dollars spent on a bogus investigation and no crimes were committed on his end. There was more crime committed by the democratic party, but it was all swept under the rug and nobody will be held accountable.  He didn't kick transgenders out of the military; he changed the law so that transgender surgery would not be paid for by the government.  Which is as it should be. It's not transphobic or homophobic. He has been taking a stance with other countries that have been taking advantage of America. He has been working on prison reform which is benefitting the black and brown community. 
Biden spearheaded a law to put drug offenders in prison in the 90's. It hurt the black community.  Trump is the one who is reforming it. 
In the last three years Trump has been helping America and the American people. The democrats have spent three years bashing him and they have done nothing to help America or the American people.

Where do you derive these from though? We didn't find rights in the rights mine, they're things we collectively decided upon. Thus, they're social constructs. Meaning we can change them to best fit our needs.

They totally can, btw, we essentially live in a post scarcity society in those respects (housing too). Thats not relevant to this discussion though.

289,Or was it the fact that Poilo was a more visceral disease (I got freaked out just by looking at its victims) but COVID is pretty much an invisible illness unless you're looking at an X-ray of its victim's lungs?,"&gt;Do you think that it is safe to say that in some ways COVID-19 is a ""Goldilocks"" (for the virus, not for us) where its just virulent enough to kill people in large numbers, but at the same time, not so deadly that it provokes the sort of nation wide response that polio did...
The thing is, it's **really** not deadly to the majority of people, with an IFR (infection fatality rate) of [0.15%](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/eci.13554). This means, what are the odds someone dies if infected? The flu on the other hand has an IFR of 0.1%. 
COVID is just strange in that, for the old over 70, this % shoots up 10-50+ times, and for the young below 40, it's effectively 0.0000% (basically no one dying purely from COVID). 
So who's at risk wildly changes, but even taken as a whole, it's not individually a danger to most. 
It does still kill people, a fair bit, because it infects so many people (again most infections occurring at home). Current estimates using serology inference point to **2 billion** global infections. 
&gt;It seems like Poilo only is really problematic in half a percent of its victims, while Covid-19 kills roughly somewhere between 1-3% of its victims so long as the have access to quality healthcare more or less...
This isn't the case, you hear this number because, for some reason, the media and governments only talk about CFR or case fatality rate, which is a terrible statistic to use. It doesn't convey actual risk of infection since officially documented active cases are literally about a tenth of total infections. 
&gt;Do you think that maybe the reason that America's reaction to COVID has been more lack luster than our response to Polio is because of the fact that it targets young people? Or was it the fact that Poilo was a more visceral disease (I got freaked out just by looking at its victims) but COVID is pretty much an invisible illness unless you're looking at an X-ray of its victim's lungs? 
Absolutely though, I think it's fair to say that most, maybe they wouldn't admit it, most people place the life of a child far above that of an 80 year old. A virus killing mostly the young would be seen as far more of a threat, even if their IFRs were identical.

COVID-19 and ""temporary"" emergency
Developed countries have passed significant legislation related to curbing greenhouse gas emissions and other efforts to slow any human driven change. That is certainly not nothing. But more importantly, I think people forget that the pace of technology advance is stupidly fast. We may not recognize it when the next iphone seems little changed from the last, but take a step or two back. Within my 40 years, we've gone from star trek communicators and James Bond watch phones and video phone calls being fantastical devices of fiction, to cellular phones being the size of a loaf of bread, to super hi res touchscreen video phones and watch phones being ubiquitous throughout the population. You carry more computing power in your pocket, but many many orders of magnitude, than was found in an entire university computing department just a couple of decades ago. As it relates to climate change, we've made a lot of progress that goes equally unnoticed most of the time in terms of cleaner ways to burn fuel, cleaner alternatives to fuel, better battery technology, better recyclables, etc. And soon enough, that technology march will develop methods to effect image change on a scale that isn't just economically unfeasible but technologically impossible currently. The same technological progress that got us into whatever mess we are in will get us out. And I think what you see as complacency by some political groups is really just the willingness to wait on technology to catch up to the problem and not wanting to devastate our economy in futile efforts in the meantime.

&gt;Placing blame solely on Trump is disingenuous and politically charged. We have 50 autonomous governors in the US, and half of them wouldn't listen to Trump regardless of his approach. I guess maybe Cuomo could have taken a lesson instead of packing nursing homes with COVID sick patients. 
I'm not entirely placing the blame on him, but he lead the charge in the decision making of the GOP, which lead to the pandemic getting worse. 
&gt;My argument is simple. Your mind was made up on how he would handle the pandemic before it started. You can disagree here, and that's fine. 
I had mostly supported him until the pandemic, not sure what you are spouting here.

as I said in my previous comment:
The left would not have outright opposed Trump if he had cracked down on the pandemic, as they were already in support of doing so. If he had done so, and shown moderate Americans that, yes, Trump could act in a presidential fashion, listen to experts, and act in our best interest, the election would absolutely have gone in his favor, by a land slide. 
when I say unite the country, I mean get us to the point where leftists have to grudgingly agree that yeah, he might have done something right. This isn't about winning the leftist or left vote, its about winning the moderate vote, which just means he has to come off as doing the right thing, and not actively dividing the country.

EDIT: My data on Israel was out of date, as mentioned in another comment. However, the death rate remains significantly lower than in previous waves despite the increased case numbers, making this evidence against vaccine effectiveness questionable at best.

A cousin of mine was once forced into quarantine on his way to to buy groceries, and had to quarantine for 2 weeks w/o adequate supplies. My relatives have mentioned that numerous people they knew have disappeared without a trace during this time. 
Another interesting point is how the pandemic effected the undocumented people in China. There are an estimated \~1 million Uyghur Muslims detained in ""internment"" camps where conditions have ""reportedly"" been abhorrently inhumane. And they are not the only religion that is persecuted by the CCP. Tibetan Buddhism, Christianity and nearly a dozen other religious groups share the same fate as the Uyghur Muslims.

Unfortunately, finding data on how many 3rd child people are in China is impossible to find for clear reasons.

Rates have already fallen well into the manageable levels.   They are still dropping.   Time and testing has shown that simple prophylaxis' such as zinc, vitamin D, and Quercetin have proven very effective in lessening the contracting of and the effects of the disease. 
COVID-19 primarily kills old people, (with comorbidities), and fat people.   The median age of death is over 80, well past life expectancy.    My aunt caught COVID-19 3 days before her 99th birthday last October.   She is neither sick or fat and is doing fine today.   You should focus your efforts on getting people to exercise rather than trying to shame people to get an inoculation for a disease that has a 99.98% survival rate for healthy people. 
Get the vaccine if you want.   The unprotected people left are those that chose not to get the vaccine primarily because it is not necessary.   They would rather rely on a natural solution called an immune system. The vaccinated are not at risk from the unvaccinated or those that have acquired natural immunity. 
This nation did what was needed.   It recognized a problem.   It created a solution for those at highest risk.   It should leave everyone else alone.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"1, while this is more of an event description, the argumentative function is very clear from the context, making it storytelling for me even if the span itself is rather objective",gxkbbc7,27,CMV
301,After you see the tenth person in 1 facility on PAL care who was literally dying a week ago with no covid... end up with covid and die... and then get counted as a covid death... it starts to make you understand the count is not as high as it is claimed to be.,"Well... the problem is you joined this conversation between me and another person halfway through it.  So now you don't have the context that we were using and you are trying to use general context when we were being specific. 
If you go back and look at the context of the conversation that you joined, and by the way, I'm fine with you joining the conversation, then you'll see we were talking about 'essential workers' specifically. 
Which is by and large any working age person under about 50.  Which makes up a pathetically small amount of people who die from this Covid.  
You can see the context by going straight up in the parent comments and you'll find 
&gt;you have to understand that this disease is not going to kill the overwhelmingly vast majority of people who fit into 'essential workers' 
Then later when you responded to my second comment, I was simply restating what I had previously said, but without repeating myself word for word due to the context already being in place. 
As for why I believe the disease is not actually as deadly as the flu, more generally speaking. 
I think you can also take into account the issue of defining covid deaths.  Which being inside the medical community by my position in life, I can tell you is absolutely over estimated, probably not by a enormous margin, but by some margin, probably a couple thousand.  I judge this because I have personally seen people marked down with covid deaths, who were simply dying anyway for many other reasons.  Covid tends to not actually kill many of the elderly, it's a comorbidity issue.  
After you see the tenth person in 1 facility on PAL care who was literally dying a week ago with no covid... end up with covid and die... and then get counted as a covid death... it starts to make you understand the count is not as high as it is claimed to be.  Which I think we will find in the future. 
You may not agree for whatever reason you might have, but I don't think any of this is far fetched.  I don't know a single doctor I've had conversations with about this who thinks even 80% of the ""covid deaths"" are in fact covid deaths though, and they are the experts in my opinion.  I speak with more doctors than most people I suspect (I am not a doctor, I do have a circle of friends due to my life and my wifes profession that I am good friends socially with a great many of them as well as many administrators of one of the largest hospitals in the US) If you are interested in examples, one that I was told a little while ago by one of the doctors, was that in the past if someone in PAL care with end stage cancer, they are on morphine, full QOL comfort mode, they are dying, the family knows it's only days.  They don't count these people as dying from Heart Failure, even though generally enough that's the specific exact reason they die, organ failure from cancer.  They are counted as deaths from cancer.  However, they specifically have to put they *had* covid at the time of death if they did in fact have covid, and they are then counted.  The doctor I'm speaking of told oversees 2 hospitals and about 3-4 assisted living facilities and flat out said the ""Count"" of his buildings was something like 100, but in reality it was no more than 70 maybe 80 for cases where covid was a *legitimate* cause of death. 
Anyway, these are the actual experts if you ask me, they are the ones who know why each specific case was dying or did die etc.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"1, is it search for solution if the narrative provides a reason why the discussed problem is not as bad so a solution is not needed?",h14j8z8,59,CMV

There's lots of info on how the lack of female representation in clinical trials hurts women's health. There are diseases that show up differently in men and women and since they don't include women in trials it's not until much later that we find out the the symptoms for women are different, and I think heart attack is one of the examples, we're told to look out for the numb arm but that's only for men. A more current example is the J&amp;J covid vaccine, women weren't included in the trials so it wasn't until cases started coming up that they found out that it can cause blood clots in women. As for the air conditioner, most offices are set to a specific temperature that was calculated from a formula that took into account the average man's body temperature and the ideal room temperature. Women and men have different ways that they store temperature, men have higher temperature in their extremities and less in their core, while women have less in their extremities and more in their core, causing them to be much more sensitive to the cold. It's not a coincidence that woman working in office buildings tend to complain of being cold in the summer.

If he was a private citizen, I'd totally agree with you. Nothing Hannity or Alex Jones or Richard Spencer say ruins my day. Trump has power and his words matter. 
&gt;Appointing a black person in a high position doesn’t make someone not a racist but it should re-evaluate our accusations about the person. 
Sure, and when I weigh crumbs vs mountains the mountains still weigh more. 
&gt;The game is to smear shit on the opponent as much as possible to take them down. 
I mean, sure. And those smears can or cannot be based on your race, so you havent really proven anything with that reasoning. Trump is a frequent user of the trope 'if you are not white then you dont belong here'. Another example being his telling 4 poc congresswomen to go back to their countries (when only one of them is a naturalized citizen, and even there that is a racist thing to say). 
&gt;because Mexico has a serious crime problem, there should be tougher border security to prevent illegal entry. 
It is not bluntness. His statements are incorrect, and are painting a large group of people with one broad brush, which is the very definition of prejudice. The statistics show a vast majority of Mexican immigrants come here for work (both documented and undocumented) and their criminal incidence is lower than average. 
&gt;Shithole countries.. Trump’s point is that America should prioritize welcoming immigrants from safe areas over dangerous ones. He thinks there should be tougher standards for accepting those from more dangerous areas. 
Bullshit. There are already such measures in place. A refugee from wartorn Syria faces a ton more scrutiny than a tourist or a worker from Denmark. And his position makes 0 sense. In fact, we *should* be taking in educated people from developing countries, as they are the most likely to stay and contribute. A Danish PhD is way more likely to go back to Denmark than a Mexican PhD. Thus, investing on the Mexican makes way more sense. 
And I am sorry, but if he gets to insult my country of origin to be blunt and edgy I get to insult him and tell him to fuck off. He is the president, he should f-ing sct like it. 
&gt;It’s the same principle for his Muslim ban. 
The muslim ban is a prejudiced, bigoted ban that makes no sense from a policy perspective. If you think a broad brush ban based on religion is not bigoted, I dont know what to tell you. And again, tons of high skilled, law abiding people were left in the lurch because of it. 
&gt; I still think that most people hate him mainly because he says mean stuff and they hear that everyone else hates him. 
I guess there is not much I can do to convince you then. All I can tell you is his policies affect me and those I love, and I hate that. Just today, it was announced that many foreign students will be forced out this fall using covid as an excuse. He and his stupid approach to immigration are going to cost us losing a lot of smart people who'd publish and innovate. 
And I don't know... maybe you don't care if the president is an asshole bully who insults everyone. I don't think it is shallow or snowflakey to think that alone makes him incompetent for the job. It is a trait that would count negatively when being chosen to lead virtually anything. 
*Final note / question*: I see a common thread in your responses (to me and others). You seem to be able to justify just about *anything* Trump says with ""oh, he is just being blunt"", extracting what you see as a ""sensible"" position from his racist generalizations and insults. Is there anything he could say or any behavior he could have that you *would* deem as unacceptable or racist?

It also feels like there are some subjects like gay people, transgenderism, pro-life vs. pro choice, mental health, etc. that you can’t discuss at all because people seem to get so triggered at their very sight. It even has gone to the lengths of perma bans and mods insulting me, because of simply voicing an opinion / for simply making a post. 
So there's a lot to unpack here. 
Let's start with the hostility. 
A lot of internet arguments are... well, _played out_, in the very literal sense. Most people who have been around have quite literally _had the entire argument_, often multiple times. Like, to the point where in any given discussion on, say, ""pro-life vs. pro-choice"", I can typically guess what the response to any given point will be. And if you're the kind of person who often has online discussions, this can start to get frustrating, and it can be very easy to imagine that someone is responding in bad faith. This is in part because it's frustrating, and in part because _there is a lot of bad faith going around_. And frankly, when you've debunked an argument for the 50th time, you start running out of patience for the people who just keep making it. Especially if it's an argument that's, y'know, _really bad_. And there are a lot of _really bad_ right-wing arguments going around. 
And yeah, there are some subjects where you'll find that some people are _extremely_ uninterested in having a debate. And given the subject matter, I'm kind of at a loss as to what the ""debate"" is supposed to be. What friendly debate would you like to have about ""gay people""? Does it involve my rights? My existence? My wellbeing? Are we trying to have the argument over whether or not I should be allowed to get married to my partner again? Because frankly, I'd _rather not_, and if you insist on having it, I will start making arguments for why people who insist on endlessly trying to rehash _my rights_ shouldn't be allowed to adopt children. Or, to put it another way: _no trans person is actually interested in debating whether their identity is valid or not_. 
And if you walk into those debates and treat it like a game of [Debate: The Gathering](https://twitter.com/scalzi/status/1025372965754621953), when what you're debating is, for many of these people, not some fanciful thought experiment but literally a question of whether or not they'll be able to access life-saving medical care... Is it any wonder they react with hostility? 
You may well come in in good faith with what sounds like an innocent argument. But you have _zero_ skin in the game. If you had researched the issue, you'd understand the problems with that argument. And there's a massive number of hostile trolls who will make it their business to repeat that argument no matter how wrong they know it is, because _they know it hurts us_. Is it any wonder that they aren't particularly patient with you when you say things that are not just wrong, but which are wrong _and_ which they have already seen a thousand times, _and_ they know that this misinformation is literally the kind of shit that makes their lives tangibly worse? 
Which brings me to my last point. 
&gt; I have made the experience that people will become very hostile should you explain any idea that is **even a little bit right leaning** 
Judging from your comments (and just demographics in general), I'm guessing you live in America, and you are referencing the American right wing. 
I need you to understand something - _the American right wing is completely off its fucking rocker_. It's not a mere matter of ideological differences or differing values, the conservative movement is, by and large, completely divorced from scientific reality at any point where science frustrates their extremist anti-government, pro-billionaire agenda. We _all_ got to watch as the entire conservative party of the USA stood up behind Donald Trump's insane lies and misinformation about Covid19. We all watched conservative figureheads publicly mock basic public safety, refuse to take _any_ of the necessary steps to slow the spread of the plague, and even _outright say that some people would have to sacrifice themselves to keep the economy running_. It's fucking death cult shit. 
And it's not just COVID - the republican party _continues_ to deny catastrophic climate change. They continue to support Trump's insane, fact-free, _democracy-eroding_ legal challenges. They elected multiple _Qanon_ supporters (reminder: Qanon is an accelerationist, fascist doomsday conspiracy cult) to congress. Fuck, y'all are still really fighting against socialized healthcare and paid sick leave, _IN A PANDEMIC_. It's _insanity_. 
It is hard to really explain the degree to which nearly _everything_ in the right-wing media bubble is either manipulated or fabricated lately. But that's the situation we find ourselves in, some 250,000 Covid deaths later. And you want to come in here with ""right-wing ideas"" and start a friendly debate? I'm sorry, but if the ideas you are supporting are popular and accepted on the American right, it's a good sign that those ideas are somewhere between ""bad"" and ""genocidal"". 
And then someone from that sphere wants to come have a friendly debate about a subject that has _zero_ importance to him but may be a matter of life or death for me?

Anti-vax; we aren't. There are just as many lib &amp; dem anti-vax as there are cons &amp; repub ones. With Covid *specifically* it is a completely different situation and completely different demographic. If it's *just* conservatives who are anti-covid-vax why are BPOC's in inner city (strong blue lib &amp; dem areas) the highest non vaccinated groups? Conservatives aren't against vaccines they are against government over reach. 
Marriage for all; I'm LGBT+ and it's mostly true when conservatives and republicans say they really haven't cared since the 90's.

Yes you can find some old crusty fucks out in the middle of nowhere who oppose the government recognition of same sex marriage but for the most part they don't' care. The only issue they have is when LGBT+ try and *force* their views on private individuals, business, and places of worship. Because once again they don't like government over reach. 
Medicare; socialized health care isn't sustainable until we figure out the illegal immigrant crisis. People who are pro socialized health care don't seem to understand that the countries that *have* it have never had to deal with illegal immigrants with US numbers and those that are now seeing an influx from the past few years are straining under it *and those number still aren't even close to what the US is dealing with*. [ UK doctors strained under illegal migrant influx](https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/371533/Overworked-NHS-doctors-refuse-to-take-on-illegal-migrants) Open boarders and non strict illegal immigration laws can't co exist with a socialized government. 
Women's rights; I'm a pro-choice conservative myself; however, I understand their talking points. The biggest issue I *do* have with abortion is that the statistics for abortions for BPOC women. Black women get abortions at *five times* the rate than of white women. It's also true that abortions have slowly been on the decline year by year. So when I hear those two things I can't *not* think of some sort of ethnic cleansing going on. 
Government support; The issue with this is that while it has good intentions it almost always has really messed up results. Just giving people stuff never ends up well. Look at welfare for singles mothers. Dem &amp; Libs *really* pushed for singles black mothers to get on welfare which had the unintended effect of devaluing the black man and breaking up the family unit.  Meaning a single woman with a child could get more in welfare than if she married, so she stayed single. This is an issue you see spreading though other minorities to; but, initially it was *really* pushed onto he black community. In fact the libs &amp; dems *realize how bad breaking up the family unit is* and even Obama mentioned missing black fathers in the household as being an issue. 
So to answer what we are trying to conserve. Small government that doesn't over reach into citizen lives; because we are adults and can make decisions for ourselves. Marriages recognized by the government; as that is the only entity that should have power to reach into an individuals life, if a small entity choses to not have me as a customer or discriminate or give me less based on who I'm sleeping with *I* can *choose* not not patron them and share my experience with that entity to others.

That is in no way exclusive to conservatives, but also besides the point; I never contested that some conservatives hold crazy views, I contested OP's position that you have to believe those things to be a conservative. 
&gt;Interestingly, your caricature of liberals is that they believe a fact, US citizens die at the hands on police at dramatically higher rates than any other wealthy country, but an exaggerated fact. 
...""an exaggerated fact?"" 
So... a lie? 
Also wealth is a fairly Irrelevant factor for comparing police shootings. Crime and civilian gun ownership are much more relevant factors, and you'll notice the US has higher rates of both than countries people like to compare us to in regards to police shootings. 
&gt;6,000+ die in prisons and at the hands of police every year and there are no numbers about how many die in custody because no one is collecting that data despite the Democratic legislation passed in 2013... so we’re closer to 10,000 deaths per annum than you’d think. 
&gt; I guess you’re just exaggerating the racial distribution and cause of death to make a point about how you made something up that no one believes as a rebuttal to someone making a salient point about Conservative voters that seem to just make things up to support whatever they want to believe. 
You'll have to cite the 6000+ number. Just looking it up the first three sources I found said closer to 5000, and that includes all causes of death, the vast majority of which are natural causes, and you have to go very, very far down the list of other causes (suicide, inmate violence, drug overdoses, etc) before you get to anything that could be called deaths ""at the hands of police."" 
And no, I didn't make it up. 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2021/02/27/cases-of-police-brutality-against-black-people-are-overestimated/amp/
And yes, obviously data collection on fatal use of force by police needs to be better. That said, its arguably one of the most discussed topics of the last decade, and there's immense focus on the issue with several very reputable organizations tracking the data and the higher numbers I've seen put the actual total closer to a couple dozen. 
So no, unless you've got reliable data showing that police kill 4-400x+ more unarmed black men than reputable sources like Mapping Police Violence have been able to find then we're not even remotely close to the numbers that 80%+ of liberals believe. 
I didn't bring this up for some arbitrary reason. I brought it up because its analogous to OP's position. Arguing that you ""have"" to believe the things OP listed in order to be a conservative just because many conservatives believe them is the same as saying that you have to believe cops kill 10,000 unarmed black men every year just because that's what a lot of liberals believe.",1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0,gxz0zit,41,CMV
314,"Sure you can argue that their parents should've come here legally, but when your family is in grave danger, what can you expect from them?","I'm not gonna attempt to change the idea that not every Trump voter is a bad person. I genuinely believe some are good, but have been so misinformed about who he is, that they mistakenly trust him. 
However, I wanna modify your stance on this:
&gt;“I can’t hang out with that person because they vote for Trump  or something along those lines. My parents are Trump supports and they (and I) have lost family friends because they support Trump."" 
Trump has bragged about sexually assaulting women. If you have a friend who has been a victim of sexual assault, they may not want to associate with you if you support Trump. I think that's pretty reasonable. Trauma from sexual assault isn't a trivial thing. 
If you have a close friend who was brought here at a young age by parents who came here illegally, they may be protected under DACA. Without DACA, your friend may be forced to go to a country they never knew and could possibly go back to a country where their family is in serious danger. If you support Trump, your vote supports the repealing of DACA and deporting illegal immigrants. Therefore, you implicitly are voting to send those like your friend to a much much harder life or even death. Sure you can argue that their parents should've come here legally, but when your family is in grave danger, what can you expect from them? And that doesn't mean someone covered by DACA should deserve to be sent back for something they had 0 control over. 
If you vote Trump, you're voting for his performance handling covid. If I have a family member who suffered or even died from covid, I'm definitely not going to want to associate with someone who supports a leader who failed to lead the country through a pandemic and lies so often for his personal gain. 
I don't think its silly to not want to be friends over who they support. There are certainly valid reasons as politics is often more than just what you see on television or online.

315,"I support the use of the vaccine. I also support people's right to informed consent, and choice in medical treatments.","
&gt;No, it doesn't. If you look at the total number of people that have cought covid and take the % that die you would have 1.8% or 98.2% that survive. 
Firstly, going by your numbers, sorry I was off by 0.8%
Secondly, as of sept 8th 2021, the [Cdc](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totaldeaths) reports total cases at 40,523,954, and total deaths at 652,480. 
That puts the death ratio at 1:62, or otherwise reported as a 1.6% chance of death, ignoring any other variable. 
The single largest standout that I've observed is age. According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1191568/reported-deaths-from-covid-by-age-us/), when broken down by age, of the total deaths in their last calculation (at 643,858). Of those deaths, 609,537 are above the age of 50, and this is before including other co-morbidities. 
If you are younger than 50 years old, your odds of death are less than 8 tenthousanths of a percentage. 
Then you bring in co-morbidities. The leading comorbidity for the US is obesity. [ 78% of all covid patients](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/covid-cdc-study-finds-roughly-78percent-of-people-hospitalized-were-overweight-or-obese.html) are overweight or obese. If you aren't obese, or have other comorbitities like you mentioned, this would lower your risk factor even more. 
&gt;The other thing is that ""your"" survival rate is not 98.2% You might have co morbidities that increase your chance of death. Things like immunodeficiency, age, weight, heart/lung issues, etc. 
So you are right, ""my"" survival rate isn't 98.2%; it's much higher. 
The bottom line is, if you aren't elderly and/or having a comorbidity that increases your risk, covid is not a dire concern and life or death for you as an individual. 
We also now know that you can [Catch](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/30/cdc-study-shows-74percent-of-people-infected-in-massachusetts-covid-outbreak-were-fully-vaccinated.html) and [spread](https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-fully-vaccinated-people-infected-can-transmit-covid-study-2021-7?op=1) the virus if you're vaccinated, which removes the incentive to protect other vulnerable people's by being vaccinated for those hesitant. 
The best case news as it stands right now is that if you are vaccinated, your reaction/symptoms as a result will be greatly reduced, lowering your risk of hospitalization or death if you are in one of the vulnerable demographics. 
I support the use of the vaccine. I also support people's right to informed consent, and choice in medical treatments. What I will not support is mandated medical procedures or treatments, regardless of reasoning or efficacy. 
I actively encourage anyone who falls into the at-risk categories to get vaccinated, but recognize for myself and others that there is legitimate reason as to why you may not want to get the covid vaccine right now, and that refusal to do so is going to have little to no impact on your or others around you based on what I mentioned above, so long as you are not in an at-risk category.

320,I try to look at both sides but I have no sympathy for selfish people that put the public health especially kids lives in danger.,"Responding to your previous comment too. First, woke to me is a good thing. Just because most of the right wing and Q crazies have created a “boogeyman”, the term doesn’t bother me and it’s not a insult to me. It’s become a weaponized word to own the libs. Lol! 
Second, it appears that your comments are a bunch of conspiratorial anti science rhetoric and mumbo that is based on big words to make it sounds factual. I know many people who get vaccines for various reasons. I’m sure you do since it’s been required for billions of kids that go to school all around the world. I don’t know anyone that’s been negatively affected instantly by a vaccine. 
I heard of it like everyone else hears about it. But I’ve heard of people being negatively affected by Motrin, Tylenol, Benadryl and other over the counter medications. People have also heard of buildings collapsing, planes crashing, shark attacks, lightning strikes etc. Most people don’t  go on to avoid going into buildings, planes, water or even outside. My point is no medicine, food, material etc that contains man made chemicals is 100% without side effects for 100% of all people. 
In fact, I questioned the anthrax vaccine I received in the military but the pros outweighs the risk. I decided I prefer not to die or become seriously ill instantly. It wasn’t even a public health vaccine. It was for my own protection. There is data to back up how many people have died of infectious diseases versus vaccines. Any epidemiologist will vouch for that. 
When it comes to public health vaccines, it should be mandated. Anti vaxxers will use every excuse even though there is no scientific evidence of widespread injury or illness. They come up with excuses like they are waiting for FDA approval, it causes Autism, Bill Gates put a microchip in it etc. They know somebody’s brother cousins friend that was sick from it but they fail to educate themselves regarding the billions of people that have no adverse side effects. I’m sure that most people that aren’t vaccinated have no problem going to the ER and getting medication they can’t pronounce to save their lives because they are doing actually that. 
There are anti vaxxers that go on to take horse dewormer and hydroxychloroquine when the FDA cautioned against it numerous times because of dangerous side effects. The anti vaxxers had no problem with that. Some anti vaxxers are selfish. People like my sister in law suffered for weeks because of the short supply of hydroxychloroquine because anti vaxxers thought it was a good idea to hoard the supply. 
Now they don’t want to take the vaccine even though kids are being affected at record number, people that need to be treated for other illnesses like strokes or car accident can’t get a ICU bed without traveling hundreds of miles, if at all. Public health is not on their mind. It’s what they think benefits them. So all the excuses are not enough when people have been getting public health vaccines for decades, the Supreme Court ruled that a vaccine mandate is Constitutional and there is no proof or evidence that millions or even thousands of people have died from vaccines. That just sounds like your definition of wokeness. 
Most Americans approve of mandating vaccines because it helps keeps everybody safe. Man, people came together during different US tragedies like 9/11. It’s shameful and sad that adults can’t do it for kids that can’t get vaccinated or to free up space in ICUs for people that have cancer or asthma. If you know somebody that was injured from a vaccine it’s almost certain you know somebody that’s been affected by this pandemic. 
Shame on you for making excuses for the minority (excluding religious, medical issues, vaccines not available to them yet) that are anti vaxxers. I understand why the vaccinated are so angry and have no sympathy for most anti vax conspiracy theorists like conservative radio hosts that have died from COVID while protesting the vaccine. I try to look at both sides but I have no sympathy for selfish people that put the public health especially kids lives in danger. That doesn’t even include the economic consequences. We have the most COVID cases in the world even though there are countries like India that have a larger population. There is no valid reason to justify anti vax propaganda.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,hcuew3f,26,CMV

&amp;#x200B;
You sound like a very decent person, I hope I didn't write anything to anger you.","I have a different opinion in almost every aspect, let's see if we can come closer in some points. 
&amp;#x200B;
&gt;I’d argue not really. I have known many vegans who have to take a number of supplements to stay healthy. And the ones who didn’t, were very thin and frail. In fact one was told by a doctor she needed to eat meat or she will develop serious health risks. She had been away from meat for so long she couldn’t consume it and became hospitalized for months. 
To be fair, that is just your anecdotal knowledge. I knew in the last 10 years about 30 vegans and you couldn't tell for anybody before if they are vegan, no one was frail or anything. Some were ""sport bros"" on the other hand, one is running marathons (maniac). Since we both can post anecdotes let's look at an official source: The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (seems to be the official source in the US) claims that a ""Well-planned vegan diets are regarded as appropriate for all stages of life, including infancy and pregnancy"". I took it from the Wikipedia article about veganism, here is the actual paper that the wiki article quotes (and the sentence is in it, I just checked: [https://digitalcommons.andrews.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2985&amp;context=pubs](https://digitalcommons.andrews.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2985&amp;context=pubs)
You are right in one point: You have to supplement Vitamin B12, which is extremely cheap and easy. I agree that this is not natural, but I would claim that almost nothing is natural in how we live, so why not take a vitamin pill from time to time. 
&amp;#x200B;
&gt;Veganism I’d also argue has worse impacts on the environment as it requires increased use of sprays for the number of crops needed to sustain a population, if you are purely going on everyone becoming a vegan, with increased production in vitamin supplements thus feeding pharmaceutical companies. 
It also takes way less water and releases way less co2/methane into the atmosphere. It depends on what you grow - you mention avocados later and yep, if you fly avocados to your home instead of eating backyard chicken eggs, it is worse for the environment. Overall, in most cases animal husbandry is bad for the environment, since it just takes more ressources to feed an animal and then eat the animal instead of just growing human food in the first place. There are exceptions (lands where nothing grows that humans can eat) but overall, livestock is usually worse for the environment. Feel free to disagree with a source. 
&amp;#x200B;
&gt;You also hurt thousands of farmers and there are already so few left where they are in an industry that has small margins based off of weather and demand. Also, having worked on a farm, there is only so much nutrients left in top soil already.  You’d risk another dust bowl with increased crop production and rotation. For example, in England, experts recommend that their top soil has roughly 100 more harvests (about 75 years) left in it before it is tapped out. Animals help to replenish the top soil but with a lessened advocation for say animals like cows and pigs, you have less fertilizer and less manure going into the earth to help replenish such things and human waste only goes so far. 
This is the thing where I am least knowledgable about. For a starter: I don't think farmers should suffer from this, I am a farmer's son myself (my father hadn't had animals but grew crops) and I know many farmers have struggles the typical office person cannot dream of. ( to be fair, also the other way round. My father could never really get his head around the fact that I had a boss, had to do what he says and cannot say what I think to him, because he was the boss of his own farm his whole life and basically did what he want every day). 
As far as I understood, there are different methods to replenish top soil. You can grow plants specifically to better the soil like clover or lupins, you can till less to not kill as many earth organisms that better the soil, like rainworms etc. The gist I got from reading articles is that there are methods that could be put to use to replenish the top soil without fertilizer. 
But I understand that you might roll your eyes about this because I haven't worked on a field for a dozen years and just ""have read some articles"". 
&amp;#x200B;
&gt;In effect, veganism produces way more problems than it would realistically solve. When looking at a large scale picture, you realize how much the animal farm industry helps the world in a number of ways from fertilizer production, milk, food, jobs, etc. 
Especially with the climate crisis, but also with the overproduction of animal feces (a huge problem in europe, not sure about the us), I would say the animal industry is bad for the planet. Feel free to disagree with a source. 
&amp;#x200B;
&gt;Take hay, which is wild grass fields, left to rest, farmers wouldn’t make anything off that anymore given the meat industry were wiped out, so those fields wouldn’t rest a lot, they’d be out to use as subsidies have lessened after COVID. England especially has a lessened subsidy for farmers for letting fields rest. 
I am not sure if I get the point: Is the bad thing that farmers get not enough money, because they don't get enough subsidies? Or is it bad that the fields are not put to use? 
&amp;#x200B;
&gt;I’d also like to point out that roughly 90% of animals on earth are edible, and some 8% of plants are edible on earth. I may be off on those numbers as I write this post, but I do remember reading the disproportionate stats about a year ago in an op-Ed about veganism and it’s in sustainability with these long term effects it will have on the world. 
I don't see how this is an argument. We only eat a few dozen animals and plant species anyway, so why does it matter how many percent of the species overall (hundreds of thousands for plants, for animals more than a million iirc) would be edible? Fascinating fact nonetheless. 
&amp;#x200B;
&gt;Take avocados that everyone loves so much. Just two avocados have a worse environmental impact than a barrel of oil because of what they do to grow them. Not only that but you have avocado cartels, where just like drugs, farmers are forced to pay for protection or are coerced into supplying or selling to these cartels. Most of Central America and South America are deforesting the jungles and forests just to plant avocados because of the profits and how much everyone wants to include them in their diet. And that’s just one example of it. You now need much more land to grow the crops if day everyone went vegan and you need a lot more farmers, water, fertilizer, chemicals, etc. 
I repeat myself a little: As far as I know you need in most cases less land and ressources to grow plants, especially if you grow it locally. I am aware of the avocado problem, but I am not arguing that everybody should eat 10 avocados instead of their steak. I didn't eat avocados for many years because of the reasons you mentioned, just started last year again (my SO is a big avocado lover, so I couldn't help myself. You could say I am a hypocrite with this). 
&amp;#x200B;

Trump promised an infrastructure plan and a healthcare plan, and after four years of his bullshit he left us with nothing but his lies and insanity and failure. 
The Republicans had plenty of time for their tax cuts for the rich and their disgusting treason, but nothing for infrastructure? 
Biden's bill will put high-speed fiber optic internet for all our rural communities. That is huge and long overdue. There is funding for childcare facilities which the Republicans have all obstructed (despite their abortion bounties and forced births policy). And their is funding for massive upgrades to cybersecurity infrastructure, because Republicans let the Russians hack us with denied that problem too. And we have climate change infrastructure upgrades, which again the Republicans are resisting because they have insisted still climate change is not real. 
Republicans had four years and failed to get any of this despite promising it. Biden did it in his first year.

1. You are completely incorrect about the influenza vaccine. I think you are getting confused because we don't always hit the correct strains of influenza as it has to be predicted 6 months in advance so some years the vaccine is not for the most commonly circulating strain and instead cover strains that are also commonly circulating they just aren't the top one. 
2. When you are vaccinated you can fight the disease before it become a bit issue. Transmissibility of flu in particular is very low before symptoms begin and if you have the vaccine you will often never get the upper respiratory symptoms that allow for transmission. 
3. In the case of covid19 there was a worry that transmission would still be high because viral shedding occurs before the onset of symptoms, this is in contrast with the flu virus, and so it was worried that while symptoms could be avoided we could still get transmission. That is not the case, transmission risk is reduced by around 50% - 70% I think it was depending on the study. These studies are still ongoing and the longer they go on the more data is pointing to a reduction in transmission. You are likely getting confused because at the outset these studies went in with the assumption that transmission would not be reduced by taking the vaccine and that was reported on in headlines. 
4. With all this in mind lets move back to your original assumptions, that whilst completely incorrect is still morally and ethically incorrect. If you are a fit a healthy person and decided tomorrow to commit suicide, whether you like it or not, that is a selfish action. There are times this isn't the case such as long term debilitating illness that significantly effects quality of life but if you just up one day and decide to kill yourself you are creating a situation where a bunch of people now have to deal with the legalities and emotional turmoil of your death. Family and friends that you leave behind etc. If you don't take the covid vaccine and you get very sick you suddenly have a bunch of knock on effects. You take up a bed in a hospital that could be used for someone else. You risk infecting others at the hospital that may be more vulnerable due to other medical issues going on at the moment. You take up a nurses and doctors time to attempt to keep you alive. You take drugs and oxygen. All this and more. All because you decided not to get an injection in your arm that could have stopped it all. ** So all things considered, even if you were right about the science, that you aren't and you haven't really even attempted to be because all the info is a google away, then you would still be an incredibly selfish individual for not taking the vaccine for the reasons stated in (4).**",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,gwxl0oq,51,CMV

&gt;So 2 out of 3 people - or 66% of the population world wide need to get ill so the virus will stop spreading. This means 66% of all of us will get it. The question is when.  
This is far from inevitability, and is extremely unlikely.  It could also just stop spreading because measures were taken to stop its spread and treat the infected.  No form of coronavirus has ever achieved 66% worldwide infection rate.  Spanish Flu got to 500million infected, or about 27% of world population in 1918, when infection control practices were relatively new and not commonplace like now, when everyone has Lysol and hand sanitizers.  
&gt;I’m a healthy dude with a healthy family in my thirties. Our chances of dying from this new virus are negligible.   
It might or might not be negligible.  
Reported fatality rate of ~2% is difficult to trust, because this is a statistic derived from infection and death numbers largely from China.  While there's reason to think the dead are diagnosed while many living infected people aren't, skewing the fatality rate high, it may also be true that China is underreporting death numbers.

&gt;Why do I want it asap? Because if I need to go to a hospital or a doctor I prefer to do it while everything is functioning normally. Once we have a few million people being ill all at the same time, treatment will be crap and that’s where it’s getting dangerous.   
This is a valid point.  Experts report ~80% of infections spontaneously recover.  However, if you end up being the 1 in 5 who have to go to a hospital over the Covid-19 however, it'll likely be a ICU stay, and death rates for people who develop acute respiratory distress seems pretty high, mostly because all treatments are experimental.  They're currently trying cancer, malaria and AIDS medications.  This favors later, not ASAP infection, because more will be known about what treatments work.  
In any case there's a 20% chance that the financial and health risks of actively seeking out coronavirus infection will outweigh benefits.

Shares of a company can very much be a physical item. You are just used to thinking of a share as a 'virtual' item. 
&gt;b. selling paintings and other goods has a value add 
No not really. I bought it for $50 and sold it to you for $100 - nothing new was created. I just extracted money $50 by selling it for more than I bought it for. 
&gt;About HFT – I agree with what you’re saying but I don’t see how it shows the benefit. I would speculate that you actually agree that HFT is not very beneficial but you’d need extra regulation. 
I do agree it is not necessarily beneficial. The question of added regulations makes me ask what the cost is for those regulations. What do they add by restricting the market. 
&gt;Share buyback – Yes, the owners will surely decide but that doesn’t mean the money is not better spent on e.g. R&amp;D or paying the employees more or lowering environment impact
But you don't get it. The owners of the company are the ones who decide what is in the best interest of the company. They make that call - not you. 
Think smaller. An accounting firm of 4 CPA's. One retires. Rather than selling that 'share', the company buys out that retiring CPA. That is what a buyback of stock is. You are mandating that they have another CPA buy in. 
&gt;Ex-dividend – One alternative would be to have a minimum time of ownership. If I really want to &lt;invest&gt; in a company, I have to be able to hold onto their shares for say one week. 
What happens if a share is not held long enough? Nobody gets the dividend? 
Why is this even an issue to you? It is a company stating, well in advance I might add, how they determine the owner of record is for dividend payments. 
The person who sold the stock knew they could have held it one more day to get the dividends but choose to sell it. You cannot just 'buy stock' on that day because you want to. Someone *has to sell it*. Somebody made the choice to forgo those dividends by selling. 
&gt;Public announcements – agree that insider trading is regulated. But certain tweets from certain presidents, which have massive impact, haven’t been investigated. Plus the whole concept of reaction to news, which drives prices because of the algorithmic nature of most trades, seems a bit fishy to me. 
Nothing is perfect. I wouldn't pick on the POTUS first though. Congress is a better place to look for insider trading violations. There are several currently being looked at with the COVID-19 situation.

It was not trying to. You are complaining about how it works and wanting to ascribe benefits to society for it. That is just not correct. 
It works the way it works because the people involved set it up with this framework to allow the buying and selling of ownership stakes in companies. None of the 'benefits' you claim are important are actually core missions of the stock market. Its sole purpose is to allow the trading of ownership stakes in companies.

He's been asking for actual competition for years. We are barely seeing it this year. Hardly objective competition, but better than what it has been.

I put it in quotes because it's relative. Elons says it'll cost the same as normal airfare. I'm skeptical myself, probably first class tickets of today sure, but not economy class.

333,"Now you may say something along the lines of ""well we don't care about the flu with mask wearing and those immunocompromised can't get the flu shot and so on"".","Ok I have read some of your replies and I will put in my 2 cents. 
First and foremost protecting the unvaccinated includes those who cannot get vaccinated. Like children, cancer patients, organ transplant receivers, etc. 
Now you may say something along the lines of ""well we don't care about the flu with mask wearing and those immunocompromised can't get the flu shot and so on"". Well the thing is that covid is a lot more transmissible and dangerous than the flu. Idk what numbers you want to confirm that for yourself but if you need them, there is always google. Also YES we should care about the flu! If everyone who had the flu self-isolated and wore masks, we would be in a far nicer world, but no, our society demands work and personal freedom over collective health. Thankfully, you don't really walk around spreading the flu until you have flu-like symptoms, so it's pretty easy to tell who is a walking virus factory.... unfortunately covid is not like that so it's not like we can just mask up the sick folks and call it a day. 
Now you may say ""AH HAH! I am vaccinated and so cannot be a walking virus factory! And even if I am, I will only infect those who are unvaccinated"" This is a nice sentiment but nope, people who are vaccinated can still get covid and can still spread it. Remember, the vaccine is not 100% effective, passing it on to a vaccinated person could give that person covid, and they in turn could develop more serious symptoms just from being in that unlucky 10% where the vaccine isn't effective. Or they could inadvertantly pass it onto a family member sho is ineligible for the vaccine. 
Now you may be thinking ""well what the heck is the point of vaccination??????"" Herd immunity is the simple answer. Imagine if the full eligible population was vaccinated. The virus can survive in a vaccinated person (where the vaccine is effective), but not for nearly as long, the virus load they create over their infection is therefore way smaller, less chance to infect the next person, thus the virus load in the population is reduced and reduced, thus reducing the chance for any individual (vaccinated, unvaccinated, vaccinated but in the shite 10% that is ineffective) to get sick. 
So why should you keep wearing a mask?? Well it's because of the unvaccinated folks. They are stopping us from getting to that miracle herd immunity percentage and so virus load in the population as a whole is still high. You do it to protect those who cannot get vaccinated and those who are vaccinated but are in the 10%. Remember this is a very very contagious and harmful virus, worse than the flu, where even recovering from the infection comes with a litany of really shite long-term impacts on health. 
Finally, unvaccinated people that are dumb and don't want to inject chemicals into their body getting sick is bad for you. Let's say they all get sick, the hospitals get overwhelmed and you have a heart attack. Guess what, getting a bed or the medical attention you need may be real difficult and if the nurses think your chances of survival are meh, they won't bother. I say this because the exact situation happened to my uncle at the end of 2020. 
Tldr; stop wearing a mask at this point risks spreading a virus that is far worse than the flu. Until we reach herd immunity, mask wearing protects the entire population, and  keeps hospitals from becoming overwhelmed.

This suggests your immune system hasn't been exposed to enough pathogens to have developed strong immunity. Being sick (or getting vaccinated) is how your body trains itself to fight disease.

In the USA, the fatality rate is closer to 2%, but has exceeded 9% elsewhere.

The number of confirmed cases of heart disease from a COVID vaccine in Denmark is zero. You are misreading this information. More than likely, these side effects were actually caused by COVID-19. 
&gt;I could list all the adverse reactions from the vaccine but those numbers are, I think to be expected and not really that interesting to me, so Im just gonna focus on the heart diseases, myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis are both symptoms of COVID-19 and you are far more likely to develop them from exposure to a virus than from a vaccine.

28 cases isn't even a large enough sample size for generalization. Your n is 3.5 million. Your probability of these side effects, assuming they are caused by a vaccine is 0.00008% which is effectively zero. You have a far higher chance of catching COVID and developing heart disease as a result. 
&gt;This is a massive red flag for me
If a 0.00008% chance of an unproven side effect that is a known side effect of the disease you're being inoculated against is a red flag to you, then your methods of measuring risk would cause you to take far more precautions in life than not getting a vaccine.

&gt; Condoms are the only PPE used. 
Look, COVID is a brilliant example of what activities in human life should have a PPE but doesn't, and the consequence thereof when a particular disease takes advantage of it.

&gt;The next morning the horse returned, bringing with it three other wild horses. "" How wonderful,"" the neighbors exclaimed. "" Maybe,"" replied the old man. 
&gt;The following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed horses, was thrown, and broke his leg. The neighbors again came to offer their sympathy on his misfortune. "" Maybe,"" answered the farmer. 
&gt;The day after, military officials came to the village to draft young men into the army. Seeing that the son's leg was broken, they passed him by. The neighbors congratulated the farmer on how well things had turned out. "" Maybe,"" said the farmer. 
The story goes on and on like that. One of the take aways is that what is good and bad is a matter of perspective. To use the Nazis as an example, what they were doing was terrible for the surrounding countries, to the Jews, to the LGBT, to the Romani and other minorities.  However from their perspective, they were reclaiming their ancestral lands, taking back (stealing) wealth and distributing it among themselves. Looted art was collected and sent to museums around the world when it wasn’t kept in private collections. They had a whole propaganda machine telling German citizens that this war was to protect them and to take back what they had lost in WWI and in wars before that. Most weren’t aware of the concentration camps, they believed that people who went against them were sent to work camps (and many were) and were being treated fairly. Lots of people benefited from the fascist government, and so to them, and to Hitler, it was good, and he was doing good. 
For a more modern example, the ultra rich who supported Trump got their tax cut and pretty much all of them made a profit during Covid. Sure they had to ignore all the horrible shit he was doing to the lower classes, to the LGBT, to immigrants... but they were making money hand over fist, and his supporters thought they would be getting a piece of that too. Also they were happy Trump was punishing “the right people” as someone said. Many people believed and still believe that Trump was a force for good. 
Now I think the Nazis were terrible and that the Trump presidency (to be succinct) was a shitstorm that will take us years to recover from, financially, emotionally, perhaps spiritual if if you’re into that.  But who is right? What is *actually good*, and who gets to decide? 
Now these are of course extreme examples. But take it down a bit. Say a person is walking down the street. A homeless person asks him for money. The person ignores him and keeps walking. Person is a dick for not giving the homeless man money right? But is he? That walking dude might need that money to feed his kids. That homeless man may use that money to buy some meth and accidentally OD on it. Or the walking dude may use it to buy drugs and the homeless person may need it to feed his kids... we don’t know, but we judge the walking person and the homeless man based only off of what we see. What the actual good is from your perspective may come from your own experiences dealing with panhandlers. 
With history we have the advantage of distance. We can look back at the life of Hitler from a dispassionate POV and look at all he as done and easily he was a shit person who did a lot more harm than good. Hitler himself while he was alive though probably thought he was doing good, bringing wealth success to his people (as he saw them) and bringing order. It’s said we are all the heroes of our own story. Even people who do shit things can believe that they are good people. Thing is, when you take into account where they came from, the lack of opportunity, the abuse they suffered, the struggles, you may see why they thought what they were doing was good despite knowing that what they were doing was actually harmful.  Abuse begets abuse, no matter the flavor. 
I’m not a Christian, but I do look at some fucked up folks I have known and think “there but for grace of god go I”. If I came up in a different set of circumstances I might also have a skewed sense of what is *actually good*.  And the other side of that is, when other people judge harshly not considering the circumstances that may bring someone to make certain decisions, we don’t give that person a chance to lean to do better, aka not learn a new *greater good*. You can see this in prisons, the ones that are focused on punishment vs ones that focus on rehabilitation. You can look up the data on which ones have the higher recidivism rate. 
This is just me, but I have a real hard time with black and white thinking. That doesn’t mean people shouldn’t have good boundaries and tolerate horrible destructive behaviors... but that nobody is wholly evil, or wholly good. Some folks deserve a chance and shouldn’t be discarded because they made terrible mistakes in their past. Someone who made a lot of horrible mistakes could do a lot for *the greater good*, because they know the path that took them far away from that and can help lead others out.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,gubxb3u,76,CMV

Definitely. However, from my perspective, since the U.S. is usually seen as a first-world country, it is not performing as well as other first-world countries in many indices (mainly the social and financial inequality). 
&gt;I feel like people don’t give us credit for this... 
Maybe a lot of non-Americans feel that the negative effects of what the U.S. has done to the rest of the world (directly e.g. wars or indirectly e.g. supports for certain ideologies) far outweigh the positive effects of the U.S. actions as superpowers for the world.

Yes, I know there are some other first-world countries that are not performing as well as the U.S. either, **but** my point is that the U.S. has the largest overall power and influence in the world.

I thought I'd give one more shot and tried the next up, the University of Florida. The analysis was only looking at household transmission, and it directly acknowledges it's limitation in the quality of the data. For example, 18 of the 54 studies involved testing only symptomatic household contacts, which would miss asymptomatic or subclinical infections.

340,"English speaking peoples would have to call it the ""Crown Virus"", ""Krone"" for Germans, ""Corona"" for Spanish, etc.","I think that there are four primary responses to this.  
The first is that by giving it a factual name identified by region, you make it easier to identify in conversation.  There are many corona viruses and if you strip the name down to just corona-# or Covid-#, we will eventually lose the ability to identify which disease we are talking about.  
&gt;""Remember when Covid-20 went pandemic?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""I think you are talking about Covid-19.  Covid-20 never went pandemic.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""I definitely remember that there was a pandemic in 2020.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Yes, but it originated in 2019.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""But there IS a Covid-20.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Yes, but Covid-20 started in Malaysia and never left southeast Asia and ...""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Wait, no, you are thinking of Covid-21.  I know that for a fact because...""
and so on.  Having descriptive names to diseases helps place them in time and space, which makes them easier to learn about (at least for the average person).  Learning about these things is important because it helps us understand what to do next time.  I bet most people who know about the Spanish flu would have no idea what you are talking about if you called it by some scientific name (even if they had heard it before).  Why do you think most people do not call drugs and animals by their scientific names.  It is too F'ing hard to remember in many cases and makes it harder to remember which is which. 
Second.  Using the same reasoning you are using, anybody could say that the name ""Corona"" itself is racist.  While I think the word is Latin in origin, it translates to ""crown"" in Spanish.  This is used to describe the crown like structures on the surface of the virus, and had no intent to saddle any Spanish speaking country with responsibility for the virus.  However, using your logic, by using a Spanish word in another language (such as English) to describe a virus, that associates that virus with all Spanish speaking peoples.  English speaking peoples would have to call it the ""Crown Virus"", ""Krone"" for Germans, ""Corona"" for Spanish, etc.  This would make communications much harder. 
Third, you are saddling communicators with unintended consequences.  If I call it the Wuhan virus, I am calling it that to clearly identify it from any other corona viruses.  If someone else then uses that mnemonic device as justification for racism, and you blame me for that usage, that is like blaming a car manufacturer for a driver's drunk driving. 
Forth, while no population is immune to the criticism that they too have likely caused a pandemic at some point in history, some modern peoples, who engage in certain behaviors have recently and repeatedly been the breeding ground for potential (and actual) pandemic outbreaks.  Are we not free to criticize such populations for their continuous folly?   For example, if the Jones family keeps dumping things into the river upstream making the river unusable for those down stream, are the down streamers not justified in calling the river ""Jones'ed up"" and criticizing the family (even if not *every* family member has contributed to the problem)?  If you say no, then you are unable to criticize anti-vaxers for any potential outbreak that might result from their behavior (without being a hypocrite).  Also, if you say no, you cannot in any way blame Europeans for 90% of the deaths that they caused in the new world (as those deaths were due to pandemic) as that would be racist as well.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,fk8h588,29,CMV
341,"It's not a stretch to say a 500 sq ft rental apartment in the city with a wretched old AC unit, 15 year old fridge, and an electric oven uses almost as much electricity as our 2500 sq ft house that has energy efficient appliances and a new AC unit.","Museums and art galleries are not the best examples, because your average person simply doesn't visit either of those local options except on rare occasions. We have an exceptional art museum in Houston, and we go like once per year, for example. Most of the people in the Met in NYC or the Tate Modern in London are tourists, not locals.   
Is checking out a new restaurant or bar really an activity that larger cities have a big edge on? Even the suburbs can offer that. Your average resident of Brooklyn, for example, is highly unlikely to travel to Queens or the Bronx to check out a new restaurant. They're going to stick to what's available locally or close to work. Most people also pick a bar that they like and then become regulars.   
For live music, you can find a scene in almost any town with more than 100,000 people. Will the options always be good? No, but they won't always be good in NYC either. It's an extremely expensive city for struggling musicians to live in. Most of my coworkers in our NYC office didn't really go see local shows anyways. They saw Beyonce or Muse or some other big touring act when they played Madison Square Garden.   
Big cities are also a chore if you have children under 10. London and New York's mass transit are a major pain in the ass to navigate with a stroller. Small apartments really fucking suck as a venue for entertaining children or getting any quiet time.   
I lived/worked in Moscow for over six years, so I'm intimately familiar with what a huge metropolis has to offer. I've traveled all over the U.S. and Europe, and even a bit in Asia.   
Oh, and the whole COVID-19 thing. It probably won't be the last lockdown for a respiratory virus in our lifetime, and it really highlighted how much large crowded cities suck to live in when access to going out is cut off.   
Admittedly I'm an introvert, and so is my wife. We really love our decently sized suburban house and our wooded backyard with the greenbelt right next to us. We can pull our bikes off the wall rack, load my son into his bike trailer, and be off on a 10 mile ride in less than five minutes. We've got space for everyone to find their own quiet time in the house. We can reach almost any major destination in Houston in under 45 minutes outside of rush hour traffic.   
So we get a lot of the advantages of the city, but without having to sacrifice living space. We know our neighbors, and we've got friends we've known for years in the surrounding area. If we could have this house and living space in the city, sure we'd love to live closer...but we couldn't afford to have this much space in the city. We're fully aware of the environmental argument...but rather than solve the issue by cramming everyone into small living spaces close together, I think technology is solving the issue slowly overtime by dramatically increasing the energy efficiency of suburban homes.

I've seen companies that made a vaccine address this and say that people have been pregnant while getting the vaccine, but you have to look at how the individual vaccines work. There are many ways a vaccine can work. 
One of the ways that has been used to make a Covid vaccine is by essentially convincing your body to target a specific protein that is fundamental to the structure of the virus. The only problem is that that protein is selectively present in human beings in one instance, when a placenta is being formed. The theory, which can be neither confirmed nor denied at this point due to a lack of research, is that if you convince your body to target that protein as a whole, then it will anc could cause issues in women in the future.

Late reporting seems obviously related to the disparity between Republicans disproportionately voting in person vs the Democrats voting by mail-- that's a pretty straightforward explanation. Unusually high turnout goes back to this being a very polarizing and intense election, doesn't it? Honestly, also, what is the alternative explanation for such turnout? In Russia you have ballot stuffing or whatever, but the whole system is much more centralized and the person doing the fraud is in actual power, not the challenger. I mean..... I'm guessing a great majority of these cases are when the party or president is the one facilitating fraud. It beggars belief that the Democrats have this much power in Republican counties..... and yet there's no hard proof except statistics. I'm not intentionally hand-waving (I actually hate most any hand-waving, honestly), but I do need specifics that depend on plausible set-ups. I admit I'm very skeptical of any and all mentions of any conspiracy in any context and would require extra hard proof just 'cause... conspiracy is sort of a lazy explanation that says proof doesn't exist for reasons. 
I admit I was a little hand-wavy about Giuliani and I'm a bit embarrassed about that. I should've added 'lately' re: things he'd done to earn my respect (as opposed to how Krebs presents himself and their current apparent base competence).

Anyway, after Trump won, people went on and on about how he lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College, for example. That seems a similar argument to saying that the popular vote might believably lean Democratic but not *this* much. It seems to depend on not being able to believe that ordinary people who otherwise vote Republican (and did, down-ticket and in past elections) would just simply hate Trump so so much. Or enough to just vote him out. Or am I wrong? Like all these questions of 'but how', couldn't they at least partly be cause for soul-searching and/or at least an intraparty self-reflection, rather than jumping to 'it has to be funny business'? For ex, one way to read 'bellwether' is 'representative', isn't it? So one reason he may have lost those counties is that these voters have shown to be sensitive to the times or are otherwise are known to be competitive. So maybe there was more advertising done there by both sides. Is that *not* the case? If so, maybe these counties just decided Trump's performance was not acceptable, especially with COVID-19. Plenty of 'normal' Democrat counties (say, on the Mexican border or in Florida) went Trump. I've seen posts in Politico about why this is due to failures by Democrats, at least in part. Why not say there's fraud in that one county in Texas? Conversely, why not have a journalist talk to these people and actually write an investigative report about what happened to create this change and how demographics or priorities may have shifted? That's the kind of open-minded questions I would expect of reasonably concerned citizens. I tend to only buy broad accusations when they come with some mea culpa attached, at least in politics.

I worry that I could inadvertently allow my kid to suffer, and I would never forgive myself knowing that I didn’t do all that I could to protect them. It’s true that being in lockdown negatively affected them, but I think masks are shown to be effective and could essentially allow for normalcy while still protecting them until they get the vaccine.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,h6mzjny,32,CMV

353,"Trump did an effective job at stopping some immigration through child/family separation, but many families also saw that as a sign to get their kids into the US before immigration became even harder so it unintentionally created a mini flood of immigration.","Serious question (because sometimes people are dicks, but I’m not trying to be): what immigration laws are you thinking of? I agree the wall is useless and creates more hassle to Americans living south of the wall but north of actual the country border; they’re Americans too, are we just abandoning them to Mexico? 
You might find that you’d prefer lax-looking laws that are more enforceable/track immigrants better than a wall that is clearly not working (if you want to groan look up rock climbers having fun on the wall - a fucking 8 year old climbs it. The wall also falls over in gusts of wind). If immigrants were registered that might be better than unregistered if it’s a given that immigrants will get into the country legally or illegally. Trump did an effective job at stopping some immigration through child/family separation, but many families also saw that as a sign to get their kids into the US before immigration became even harder so it unintentionally created a mini flood of immigration. The economic downturn has been the best thing keeping immigrants out - it’s insane that the best anti-immigration policy we have now is to fucking hurt our own economy. Personally, I’d rather not hurt the economy on purpose so a different policy seems smarter for limiting immigration. That said, I also know a lot of people who got hurt by lowered immigration - farmers, ranchers, and meat progressing plant owners. I live in a big agriculture area and between immigration rules tightening and covid food has literally rotten on the vine. We know from experience that Americans won’t do that work, and (my opinion is that) most Americans won’t buy more expensive food. Farming is a huge part of American identity and I would hate to see us fuck over farmers and ranchers in an attempt to lower immigration, at least not without seriously considering the downstream impacts of those laws. 
One thing democrats don’t like to talk about with Obama was that he wasn’t very “liberal” when it came to immigration. On the face he seemed pro-immigration and basically said illegal immigration was fine and dandy, but he’s also called “the deporter in chief” for a reason. Quietly deporting people doesn’t make headlines, but it also doesn’t result in floods of immigrants caravanning up to our border because they read headlines saying “borders closing!” and think they can slip in under the wire before it gets harder to cross. We have to be sneakier than immigrants. Putting up immigrants in detention centers costs money we can’t afford to spend, and if we had extra cash it’s money we’d rather let US citizens keep in their bank accounts instead of pay to the government in taxes. Right now we pay a lot more to house them than to send them back to Mexico on a bus.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,g1b7ug4,46,CMV

I'm reliant on people close to me to be vaccinated and take necessary precautions to sort of protect me. I know strangers won't do this, but close family members and my SO has done every precaution. I personally think that until herd immunity is reached people should be getting vaccinated and listening to the precautions to decrease the number of infected and protect the rare minority who can't be vaccinated (this just happens along with that action). I think the motive of wanting to decrease the number of infected is just common sense, but if a person doesn't do everything to do so it's kind of doing the opposite of what'll be beneficial for a society willingly.

this is my biggest point. If the virus came from china and we knew about it from time. Why didn't we lock down as soon as possible? 
Are we talking about the US in particular? Or the world in general? Because in the case of the latter the answer is that some places did, some places didn't. A full lockdown is hard, and while places like Taiwan were immensely successful, a lot of other countries had neither the infrastructure nor the public will to shut down when things didn't seem bad. 
If you mean the US in particular, it is because your president was a fucking idiot. Also because the 50 state structure makes it difficult for the US to adequately organize a response. 
&gt;not only that but the case of allowing the Entity in which the virus originated from be held without consequence. I understand that China is a super power but the idea that they won't point the finger at China at all is concerning and they mock trump who's used as a scape goat character to discredit this idea. 
  

  

It's Bio terrorism even if unintentional. millions have died yet no responsibility. why is no one being held accountable people like pointing the finger. where is it being pointed to? The people themselves? FOOLISH people get your vaccine it's you guys not following our guidelines and restrictions
Part of the issue with this is that it isn't helpful. China didn't intentionally let the disease through their borders, anymore than my country of Canada can blame the US for royally fucking us over by all the americans who sauntered up here without even basic protections against disease. 
There is no evidence that they intended to do this (it has hurt them immensely from a financial point of view for basically no real gain on their end), so at best you can say they didn't manage to lock it down in time. But neither did the US. Or the UK. We have hundreds of 'Delta Variant' cases in Canada, should I be saying that we should punish the UK for not containing the spread of the variant? 
&gt;now you will identify the people who refuse this ""non mandatory vaccine"" and you will restrict them because what? they are a threat to public health? The virus was said to only harm those at risk such as elderly and people with medical conditions . let them have the vaccine first . how about you do more testing before you try to expand it to the whole population who will not experience long term effects from this Virus . and don't try to push this booster shot idea for something that people can get over in 2 weeks . 
Correct, yes. If you choose not to get a publicly available vaccine without reason, then you are knowingly risking the health of others for no adequate reason. Even if it only harmed people at risk (it doesn't, it could straight up kill you, it is just less likely), you carrying it puts other people at risk, which is why we want you to get the vaccine. 
Herd immunity is a fairly basic concept. If you can't get it, you can't pass it. If the overwhelming majority of people can't get it, then it stops spreading entirely. Then grandma is less likely to die. Or my immunocompromised niece who has spent the last year and a half living in fear that some asshole is going to cough on her and end her life, someone who can't get the vaccine because of her condition. 
As for testing, the various covid vaccines are actually tested in the same sort of way we would test most new vaccines. The only difference is that normally we would test vaccines in various stages. Stage one goes well, okay now do stage two, now three. Instead many of these tests were done in parallel, allowing what is normally done over the course of multiple years to be done in one. 
&gt;it baffles me how educated people and medical professionals aren't speaking out against this
  

  
logic should be enough . people are dying from the virus yes. but there is no doubt that the media is selling a narrative and if you refuse to see it . then you're lost

No, I'm not saying that, because I'm not an immunologist or a virologist or any sort of specialist in infectious diseases. It's certainly possible that COVID could become *endemic*, and that becomes a bigger possibility the longer we have large groups of infected people providing a pool for mutations. 
&gt;there will always be a new variant. 
Only if there's a large enough population to hold a reservoir of the disease that allows for mutations. I'm not a doctor, but I know enough about biology that you only get break-through mutations in larger populations. And it's not enough to be ""a new variant""; the new variant has to be able to infect immunized persons **and** have the same key traits as the main virus. ( long asymptomatic period with moderately high transmissibility) A new variant that gets you sick immediately won't be an issue, and neither will one that doesn't infect as well. 
There have already *been* a half-dozen COVID variants that went nowhere. 
&gt;Your severely downplaying the power we have given the government-
...which is not part of the view that OP was asking to be changed, but since you put your nickel in the jutebox, let's dance that tune. Governments have **always** had **tremendous** power to act in the interest of public health and safety. And in minimally-regulated economies like the West, busineses have had lots of power. 
&gt;at least admitting that the power they have taken will never be given back willingly. 
That's a rather... odd way to read ""hey, some of these things are good ideas and work well, so let's keep doing them, even if not for the original reasons we started with"".  It's even weirder to talk about ""the power they have taken"" when talking about vaccine requirements for public schools, or businesses setting health and safety restrictions on guests, or anything else that *was already commonplace and normal* for every *other* kind of communicable disease. Contact tracing and requiring tests isn't new; it's been standard public health policy for tuberculosis for *over a generation*. Requiring proof of vaccination for public schools is the same: it's been a public health policy for over a generation. And ""no mask = no business"" isn't different in any meaningful way from ""no shirt, no shoes, no service"".

This paper debunks that notion.

Also you are believing in the notion that meat eaters can only buy locals and vegans not. Unlike a lot of anti-vegan propaganda would have you known, we don't just eat almonds avocado's and beyong burgers.

Also like I mentioned, veganism has been determined as the best diet for GhG mitigation. The source is in the body of this post. 
&amp;#x200B;
\&gt; Unfortunately, I don't think there's a single diet switch that can make your eating ethical 
&amp;#x200B;
But that was never the point. The point is that its MORE ethical than omnivorous. 
&amp;#x200B;
\&gt;  due to our disconnect from our food and how it is harvested, there is some not a 'purely ethical' method of eating (aside from maybe dumpster diving). 
&amp;#x200B;
Thats both a strawman fallacy and a nirvana. When debating veganism we compare the environmental and moral issues with another diet. No one here every suggsted its a perfect diet or a completely ethical one. 
&amp;#x200B;
\&gt; I would argue a person who grows their own food, and hunts from overpopulated species
&amp;#x200B;
Something very little have the luxury to have access. And we are talking about cases where overpopulation is an actial threat and not a minor inconvinience. But I do agree, in a lot of these overpopulation contexts it can be moral. 
&amp;#x200B;
\&gt; perhaps grows their own livestock
&amp;#x200B;
Less moral. A.I still happens, short life spans still happen, castration if a bull exists still happens and they still get sent to the same immoral slaughterhouses. 
&amp;#x200B;
\&gt;  I would suggest that being vegan or not is less important than just actively trying to limit ethical issues in your diet in a way that is possible and sustainable to you. No diet is without ethical dilemmas - and while a homestead farmer and a vegan may face different ethical dilemmas, they are both moral by virtue of putting in a daily effort to minimize that impact.

I agree with the OP that the fact that the population has access to this evidence and still votes for him is very telling of state of critical thinking and education as a whole in the country. 
 Is anyone being taught how to identify logical fallacies? I just watched Tom Cotton explain that because the people voted a majority republican senate in 2016, they had mandate to block obama's nomination, ignoring the fact that the people werent voting for candidates solely for the one issue of supreme court justices. He also stated since they voted a majority republican senate in 2018 for Trump, they also had a clear mandate by the people to vote in this new candidate for Trump. Again, voting wasn't for the justices specifically so calling that out is not completely correct. He also failed to mention the House was overtaken by the democratic party so how does that okay I to the mandate from the people? He also was questioned on the polling that said the majority of the US wanted them to wait until after the election. He immediately dismissed it saying that poll doesn't count. So basically, anything that goes against his narrative doesn't count. Sound familiar? Trump does the same thing. "" Fake News!"". One minute he is singing the praises of FOX news, then the next he is calling them ""fake news"". Anything bad against him is fake! Anything good for him is real and the truth! Convenient how that works isnt it? 
Do you need to leave if he wins again? IDK it depends on what he can get away. If the Senate goes to the democrats, no worries.

The actual rate of deaths to vaccination appears to be \~1/1,000,000. Even that is skewed heavily as almost all of those deaths are among high risk populations, and of those basically all are the now discontinued astrazenica vaccine with its clotting issues. 
To know three separate people, one of whom who died from the vaccine? The odds of that are so low that I can't believe you.

The various vaccines were under tested and pushed out very quickly. It's how for example the astrazenica vaccine was pushed out despite causing blood clotting problems in a noninsignificant amount of people. It's not unreasonable to wait until there is better data. 
As I mentioned before, development was quick because of advantages unfamiliar to previous vaccines. They still did the necessary data collection from volunteers, it’s just more condensed. Plus, the data we’ve seen so far is that the disease itself is a little bit more concerning than what you may or may not get from the vaccine. 
I do agree that the AstraZeneca one’s a bit concerning, but Moderna, Pfizer and even J&amp;J? So far, nothing really super concerning or scary beyond allergic reactions have been noted. 
&gt;Questioning science is scientific. Not questioning drugs because the alternative is scary is not scientific. If someone ever says ""the science is in and..."" they likely don't understand science. Nothing is sacred and off limits to being questioned in an intelligent way. 
You are right on that, and I wouldn’t be too mad at those who *at least* studied what was in it. The problem is those who’ve decided against it not on genuine information but on blatant misinformation (i.e. the Karen corners on Facebook) and fearmongering. Deadass, I’ve seen people say that vaccines have “microchips” in them... Like, what??? 
&gt;Another example being that virtually no testing had been done on pregnant women. This means that there isn't reliable data one way or the other on it. It is not then unreasonable for pregnant women to not want to take the chance. 
That’s fine. That’s why I mentioned those who have valid medical concerns for not taking it. It’s those who’re like “Ummm I’m gonna fake cancer to not get the vaccine XD” or those who’re not getting it for any non-medical reason is what I’m mad about. I’m not pregnant or have any medical reasons not to get it, and therefore, I’m gonna do my part to get it.

If I’m honest, the fact that people even feel the need to talk like this is a sign that science has taken a back seat to social engineering.  Genuine questions about the choices made for regulatory enforcement and scientific methods lead to derision and “wanting to be nice.”  What a sad state of affairs. 
&gt; Getting COVID is undeniably worse for most of the population than any adverse effects from the vaccine. We have widespread real world data on how effective these vaccines are and that, in my opinion, supersedes any data from clinical trials. 
But there’s the unavoidable factor of time.  We can’t know long-term effects because we haven’t studied anyone long term yet.  And one thing no one has actually told me about that I suppose I should have asked is this: if there were to be long term effects, what might they be?  Since mRNA vaccines on humans are relatively new, how would we know what to anticipate and look for in follow up for the trials? 
&gt; Additionally many other regulatory bodies across the developed world have authorized these vaccines not just the FDA. That should give you some degree of confidence as well that extremely distinguished scientific bodies globally believe these vaccines are safe and effective for their populations. 
As a global public health community, we lack standards harmonization, so this actually backfires. Everyone is using different methods and standards to evaluate the drugs and treatments, which means that you can’t really compare.  Its one thing that absolutely needs to change.  And I’m torn here because on the one hand, multiple different methods arriving at the same conclusion can be considered an indicator of the strength of that conclusion.  But alternatively, the fact that no one uses the same methods makes cross-comparison impossible, too.  
&gt; Finally you raise the point about not knowing the long term effects of the vaccine. While this might be technically true, we have begun studying the short, medium and long term effects for COVID survivors and we know many of those effects to be very bad including lung scarring, brain damage and a laundry list of others. 
Things like Vioxx make me wary of this line of thought.  Multiple post-approval longitudinal studies were needed to convince the FDA that the heart attack risks were real, and it is still approved in other countries, amazingly. 
&gt; You seem like a rational person who wants to be safe. As a fellow rational person I think you should make the best decision with the information we do have available. Please get vaccinated friend. If you are hung up on the EUA please more that Pfizer will almost certainly get fully authorized in the coming months and you could consider that a very safe and effective option. Good luck to you
I appreciate it, I am thinking about Moderna because I trust NIAID as an infectious disease agency, and they worked with Moderna to create that vaccine.  I just know that for any other pharmaceutical product, the notion of widespread rollout prior to FDA Approval or the finishing of at least 2 RCT Phase 3 trials would elicit calls of corruption and allegations of unsafe conduct.  One other commenter asserted that no vaccine completes Phase 3 trials before going to market.  If that person, or anyone else for that matter, can show this to be true, it would mean waiting on long term, finished phase 3 trials is irrelevant in the vaccine sphere of medical research, which would mean I’m worrying about nothing.

He installed people in the CDC to try to alter the morbidity reports to show a more positive spin on the numbers. I could go on and on about that let me know if you need more. 
Then there is this new stance he is taking to try to completely discredit mail in votes. He is constantly jabbing at it, saying they are fraudulent and he is going to fight to have them invalidated. He is making referenced that he won't step down if he loses. That he will file lawsuits to have the votes invalidated. He placed DeJoy as the head of the USPS and suddenly sorting machines are being destroyed. 
""Racism is better today than at any other time in human history"". Are you attributing this to Trump? Did he do something to promote this? Is this even a true statement or do.you just feel like it is? 
I could go on for a long time. Of course there is some hyperbole from the partisan networks, but the truth is right there for you and everyone else to see. I agree with the OP that the fact that the population has access to this evidence and still votes for him is very telling of state of critical thinking and education as a whole in the country. 
 Is anyone being taught how to identify logical fallacies? I just watched Tom Cotton explain that because the people voted a majority republican senate in 2016, they had mandate to block obama's nomination, ignoring the fact that the people werent voting for candidates solely for the one issue of supreme court justices. He also stated since they voted a majority republican senate in 2018 for Trump, they also had a clear mandate by the people to vote in this new candidate for Trump. Again, voting wasn't for the justices specifically so calling that out is not completely correct. He also failed to mention the House was overtaken by the democratic party so how does that okay I to the mandate from the people? He also was questioned on the polling that said the majority of the US wanted them to wait until after the election. He immediately dismissed it saying that poll doesn't count. So basically, anything that goes against his narrative doesn't count. Sound familiar? Trump does the same thing. "" Fake News!"". One minute he is singing the praises of FOX news, then the next he is calling them ""fake news"". Anything bad against him is fake! Anything good for him is real and the truth! Convenient how that works isnt it? 
Do you need to leave if he wins again? IDK it depends on what he can get away. If the Senate goes to the democrats, no worries. If he has another 4 years of complete support from the Senate and AG Barr letting him rule as a mini dictator?

I knew going into this that you were a bad faith actor, but I'll explain this, WHO has several documents, research papers, and recommendations on COVID prevention at this point. Trump had questioned masks and floated re-opening across the whole of last year.

Surprisingly, the trend caught on, word spread on social media about how masks can slow the spread. Soon half the country was at their sewing machines making masks, helping out their neighbors, donating material to each other. [ A website was made](https://www.damerousky.cz/) where you can check who's making masks, who wants to but needs material, who has spare material, where masks are being distributed and so on. Some people have even switched over to using more technical materials as they became available.

I think you are vastly underestimating the technology that space exploration provides us. Here is a link with more common items. Of course many of these items have pieces from space exploration / NASA, not necessarily the entire item. 
https://247wallst.com/special-report/2019/06/13/inventions-we-use-every-day-that-were-actually-invented-for-space-exploration
Besides simple tech, space exploration absolutely advances our knowledge of the human body. Take Mark and Scott Kelly for example. They are twins and astronauts, so NASA studied how their bodies were affected while one remained on earth and the other on space. 
https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-twins-study-results-published-in-science
One area of interest is telomeres, which is thought to be one of the keys to how humans age. As these telomeres shorten, our cells DNA is more likely to suffer transpositions or other altering affects during cellular division. 
You're also ignoring all of the advances in mathematics. Rocket scientists from the 90s literally took over Wall Street using partial differential equations from fluid mechanics. These quants helped form hedge funds and more advanced arbitrage techniques that greatly accelerated technology usage in an otherwise analog field. Today we have numerous  low or no commission brokers, robo investment alternatives, and access to markets that people in the 90s wouldn't be able to fathom. 
&gt;Fundamentally I think it's stupid and childish to think sending humans to other planets is a worthwhile use of resources when there are problems so much more manifold and concrete down on Earth
That's fine. You can have your opinion. But unfortunately not every engineer and scientist agrees with you. I hope you agree that when people are able to dedicate their energy to something they are personally invested in, they are more likely to find success. So I'll grant you that there probably is an ""ideal"" economic assignment of resources based on expected return, and maybe space exploration isn't as high on that list as other Earth bound ventures, but these assignments would certainly ignore the human utility factor that can provide meaningful differences.  As an example, look at the Wright Brothers. They were outgunned and outresourced by Langley (who even had government funding) and yet the Wright Brothers were able to put the first controlled flight in the air despite their relative lack of knowledge and resources. Human intuition and grit cannot be ignored. 
I also think you're critically ignoring the empathy gains. Let's look at the Covid vaccine here. As humans, we have a common enemy in developing a vaccine to inoculate the race and we're all fighting against the clock. And yet we have companies competing and not sharing their proprietary data, countries refusing to do business with companies from other countries (India, China, Russia) to some extent, and a fight amongst world powers over the limited supply. 
In contrast, the international space station routinely brings people from other countries together (and to an extent, their governments) in order to solve the problem at hand.  I'm not an elementary school student, but I would imagine that watching a live feed from the space station with people from different countries could help humanize the otherwise ominous media portrayal that can occur.

And we **know** that the coronavirus can kill you. 
&gt;There haven't been long term affects established with the vaccine. 
Do you use any medication at all? Why? You don't know if you could experience some unique long term effects. That ibuprofen pill you took might give you a heart attack in 40 years and kill you. 
How long are you going to wait before you get vaccinated? Two years? Five years? 10 years? 30 years? 60 years? 
With ANY drug/vaccine/etc. that you could take, there is always an infinitesimal chance that some side effect could appear 10, 20, 60 years down the line. But the fact of the matter is that with virtually all vaccines, if there are severe side effects, they typically manifest [within two months](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine) of inoculation. 
&gt;Could it be safe? 
If it's passed phase III, given emergency use authorization, and it's been available for more than two months, then we can say that it is safe. 
&gt;Could it create heart problems
But we **KNOW** that the coronavirus can create severe health problems for you, and we **KNOW** that vaccination will decrease both the likelihood that you will be infected and the severity of the illness if you do get sick. 
If we dumbed this down to some simple math, this whole argument is like deciding to drink between two cups. 
Cup 1 contain a poison that we know ***is*** capable of killing people. It has killed people before, and it has killed people who are like you before. 
Cup 2 contains something that ***may or may*** ***not*** be capable of killing you. We don't know if it can kill you. Many people have drank from this cup, and many of them are like you. But none of them have died. 
&gt;Putting those 2 on a weight balance and deciding if taking an untested vaccine is worth it,
Guess it's a good thing that no one is asking you to take an untested vaccine, then. 
If the FDA gives something an emergency use authorization, they have determined that the benefits heavily outweigh the risks (Frankly, the same holds true for approval). 
&gt;especially after looking at how innocent the virus is
Blow it out your ass. The ""innocent virus"" has killed as many Americans as than the American Civil War. 
&gt;I'll take my chances without the vaccine. 
Again, it's not just about you. It's about the people who can't be vaccinated. I don't care if you want to kill yourself. But you aren't the only person being harmed when by a refusal to get vaccinated. 
The same way that I don't care if you lock yourself in a garage, with no one else, and turn on your car. But I do care if you decide to go speeding through a school zone.

Before I start, I'll mention I'm in Australia, and we've done a pretty good job of maintaining COVID here. 
I think the issue runs a lot deeper than this. There's a wide variety of reasons someone can refuse a vaccine, and not all of them are reasons we can judge. 
For example, an ED physician I work closely with told me recently she's not getting vaccinated because she's pregnant and has a high risk of developing a blood clot / pulmonary embolism due to familial history. Her being pregnant already places her at higher risk, and she made an informed decision to decline vaccination as there aren't many studies into pregnant women for her to be comfortable. I wouldn't necessarily call this declining a vaccine, I believe this is instead an informed decision. 
I can understand the apprehension for some medical practitioners in other ways. I don't know your aunt, but for all I do know, she's also pregnant. There can be other, completely valid reasons to refuse a vaccine as a medical professional -- what if you're allergic to a component? Or what if you aren't necessarily a frontline COVID worker, say you work in a clinic, is it refusing a vaccine if you decline it in favor of others receiving it before you? Those who ARE frontline, and may need it more. 
At the end of the day, that's why I believe in making it a strong recommendation. Medical professionals on the whole know and understand the risks for vaccinations. Should we blanket all those who refuse vaccinations as being negligent? I don't think so. I think we need to allow people to make their own decisions regarding their high risk of being vaccinated. An informed decision in this scenario is vastly different from a blanket rejection. 
Now, am I saying your aunt is making that informed decision? No, again, I don't know her, but I also believe she's a minority of health professionals. The vast majority of us are passionate. We have to be.

Nixon in the 70's, Clinton in the 90's, and Trump in the teens.","The thing you have to understand about conversations like this is that they are pretty moot while the person is still in office.  He had some firsts, and that will give history teachers 150 years from now to lay some trivia on their kids.  How those firsts turn out though remains to be seen, and they ultimately will decide how he ranks. 
He started no wars for the first time since Eisenhower.  That's kind of interesting because we are a war mongering nation.  I think he did increase civilian casualties in one of the 7 wars Obama started, but that doesn't seem to be all that significant. War is what we do, so unless that changes in the future, it's more of a ""meh"" fact that's neither a positive or negative when compared to other presidents but will be useful on trivia night. 
We have an impeachment trend that seems to repeat itself every 20 years. Nixon in the 70's, Clinton in the 90's, and Trump in the teens.  If this trend continues, then Trunp will become just another president that has gotten impeached without a conviction.  Impeachment being a political, not a criminal proceeding, people in the future studying this will not react emotionally that the Republicans saved him. 
Being a social nitwit happens pretty regularly in the office. Trump was embarrassing but then so was Bush.  LBJ stands out as particularly bad given what he said about the civil rights bill. I won't repeat it here. 
Our economy continued to rise for his first three years till COVID hit. You can say he kept Obama's torch burning there, but that is certainly not a negative.  His Covid response and the economic impact will be compared with other world leaders.  There are lots of countries going through extremely hard times other than the U.S. I doubt his response will be remembered as much worse than most of the rest of the world. 
He visited with the North Korean leader.  It will likely come to nothing.  If N. Korea starts warming up to us in the next few years, it will be remembered as an important first. 
Same thing with the China trade war.  If Biden shuts it down it will barely be remembered.  If it continues and later causes China to be less of a bad actor, history will give him credit for starting it. 
In any event, you will need three or four generations to die off and have Trump go out of living memory so that people can study his presidency free of emotion.

It's nearly impossible to find a perfect analogy but I find them helpful for extracting principles from similar examples.  It's an easy way for most people to remove themselves emotionally from a scenario.  
Some estimates of climate change project sea levels to rise by up to 2-3 feet by the end of 2050.  For people purchasing real estate in Miami, FL, today, they are purchasing land which is projected to be either directly underwater within the next 30 years, likely before their original 30-year mortgage is finished, or they will at least be property owners of land that's not flooded yet, but in a city that is dealing with significant consequences, such as contaminated freshwater sources.  For this analogy, these are less healthy individuals who have a statistically higher probability of death, hospitalization, or significant effects from Covid due to obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, improper nutrition, and diabetes.  
In Arkansas, someone else purchases land.  This person represents those who maintain a healthy lifestyle through physical activity, limited screentime, balanced diet, and sufficient exposure to sunlight. 
While the same climate change affects both properties differently based on location, Covid also has a tendency to affect individuals differently based on their lifestyle habits.  
While climate change may wreck Miami, the homeowners in Arkansas have significantly less present concerns due to climate change, especially when compared to the concerns of the populace of Miami.  
\&gt;In the current climate, where do many people are foolish and not taking prior precautions, what other recourse do we have other than mask mandates and/or lockdowns? 
Back in 1945 the US dropped two nuclear bombs.  It was an instant gamechanger in warfare and relationships between nation-states.  Last year, the lockdowns were the nuclear bomb equivalent of power given by the populace to their nation-state.  From reading history, I can't think of very many circumstances where nation-states voluntarily ceded power that had been given to them by their citizens. 
I don't think the best outlook is, ""I'll accept lockdowns unless a better recourse option is available"".  A better one is, ""I'll only accept lockdowns IF the government has demonstrated they are using their full scope and leverage to prevent the lockdowns from being necessary."" The Biden administration compartmentalizing policies regarding Covid vs. illegal immigration demonstrates that Covid isn't drastic enough to warrant lockdowns being necessary.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,h7fuxjg,75,CMV
393,"they aren't as social. so unless you have a direct line into their living rooms, they're not so easy to find...or connect with. getting them to go out is harder. getting them to open up is harder.","there's a lot to unpack here, but let's give it a shot. 
1) there's a big difference between ""introverted"" and ""shy"", and that's the whole ballgame. 
sure, you can meet women who are into shy-type guys...prob is, they often want to do all the talking. in my experience, people who yap a lot often have less on the inside. 
but if you want to meet a shy or introverted woman, that's hard because...well...they're introverted. they aren't as social. so unless you have a direct line into their living rooms, they're not so easy to find...or connect with. getting them to go out is harder. getting them to open up is harder. knowing what they're thinking is harder. 
same goes for introverted guys. not a lot of women are so into guys they have to chip away at. yeah, some women go for the ""mystery""...but you'd better be attractive and have amazing eyes, or you'll just be a skinny dork who acts shy and is afraid of women, and probably looking and acting like a virgin to them. 
which can be dangerous, because just like guys, women can be predators too. i've seen a thousand guys get burned by women because they preyed on the shy ones, who they considered weak...taking them for everything they have, taking advantage of their gentle nature, giving them a carrot on a stick. when there actually was no carrot...there wasn't even a stick. there was just disgusting selfishness. these freebooters are everywhere. beware of them. 
&amp;#x200B;
2) it depends on whether the girl likes to talk or not. i get along (mostly) with my wife because i talk a lot, and she only talks when she's pissed off about how Trump and his lot are wrecking America again today. but ask her about deep emotions, feelings, love, friendships, connections, etc...and she doesn't have much to share about that. she just doesn't like talking about it. it's not her thing. 
she'll just say ""idk, my friends are just my friends, we love each other."" or something like ""of course i love you, i married you, right?"" and so on. it's just how she is. 
meanwhile, i talk a lot (maybe you've noticed). so she mostly sits there listening while i ramble about everything from cuts of steak, to the finer points of cultivating marijuana, to the poor decisions made by the Mondale campaign, to the overarching effects of the Crimean War on mainland Europe...yeah, it doesn't always deeply interest her, but she just listens and says ""that's pretty interesting"". or sometimes she starts falling asleep, lol...which is ok, because it probably gets pretty dull at parts. i accept that. 
i mean, how long can you listen to someone discuss his thoughts about the Battle of Antietam, the subtexts in Amiri Baraka plays, or the potential generational societal influences of covid? it would put anyone to sleep  ;D
some people are cities, populated by millions...others are islands, populated by one. and we're all ok. it just matters if you match with a woman you meet. does she like to talk or listen? 
because women who like to talk enjoy quiet guys. women who like to listen enjoy (or at least tolerate) talkative guys, lol  ;)
&amp;#x200B;
3) the same goes for women who like loud, extroverted, *watch-me-chug-this-jagermeister-then-jump-off-the-garage-roof-into-the-half-full-pool* types of guys. 
it's all about matching personalities. 
if sitting on floofy couches in dim candlelight smoking a fat joint while sipping coffee and listening to soft Charlie Parker jazz, and having a friend to pass the time with you, you'll do well with quieter women. 
if wearing a red plastic sombrero bearing the dubious legend FIESTA PUTOS on Cinco de Mayo and double-shotgunning warm Iron City beer in Daytona Beach without any sunscreen is more your scene, you probably won't get along with an introverted woman. 
birds of a feather. 
in my life experience, it's not so much about ""what you're like"". it's all about ""what you like"". 
my wife? she likes quiet nights at home. she isn't really a quiet person--in fact, she can get damn loud when she's angry, especially about ""That Pigfucker Trump"", but she likes quiet things. 
coming home from work on Friday evening, sitting around in her panties and a tank top, smoking her bowl on the couch, watching Disenchantment or Bojack Horseman...that's her idea of perfection. bars and crazy parties? nope. in fact, those scenes make her agitated and inspire her to recite extemporaneous lists of reasons Why She Despises Humanity. 
and i'm exactly the same way. 
it's why despite our many differences and disagreements, we've gotten along these 20 years. 
not what you're like...but what you like. 
it's why she tolerates my verbal diarrhea every day of her life. and why i tolerate her reticence. 
&amp;#x200B;
4) finally: we can't deny or ignore it. some women like silverbacks; others like betas (i say this in the nature sense, not the neckbeard sense of the word). 
my friend Sally adores ""macho"" guys. big ol' trucks, camouflage hats, Country Thunder, big muscles, loud talkers, hard drinkers, guys who can shop with confidence among a wide variety of fishing reels, scruffy construction boots (steel toes are a bonus...it seems that makes you extra tough, like a Terminator, if part of your anatomy is metal, even superficially so), the type of guys who shoot small, furry animals with enormous firearms and count that as emblematic of their primal masculinity. 
not the types wont to discuss post-modern feminism or the political nuances of BLM. or the subtexts in Amiri Baraka plays, for that matter. 
meanwhile, my wife loathes those types. they actually make her physically ill. why? because while they talk loudly and openly, the context of their content is distressing. she won't even hang out with Sal when these guys are around, because, quote, ""I can't promise I'll keep my mouth shut about how idiotic they are."" 
but she likes me, so does that make me a beta? probably. but i've heard tell that betas who don't beat themselves to death trying to behave like stereotypical alphas are secretly the true alphas...and if my record of gaining relationships (and nudity) with women is any indicator of that claim's veracity, well...i'm inclined to believe it's truer than most guys probably care to believe. 
twist ending: the betas are quietly superior. it's an unlikely outcome even Yann Martel would grin at. 
&amp;#x200B;
where is all this leading? maybe nowhere. but it's safe to say your original claim isn't quite universally true. 
some people like chocolate. some like vanilla. some like pistachio. others like mississippi mud. 
if we combined all the ""Women actually like...."" writing on earth and attached it end to end, that device would likely snake from here to Betelgeuse. at the end of the day, women are only human. they have all the likes and dislikes we guys have, and they're all unique. 
maybe your friend is just smooth with the repartee. maybe he has a great smile, great eyes, or a nice physique. maybe he just ""gets it"" with social intelligence, for whatever combination of reasons none of us can define. the same way some of us just ""don't get it"" for whatever combination of reasons. 
i've noticed that charisma is pretty universal. if a guy makes and keeps friends easily, he tends to meet and keep women easily, too. some people are ""just likable"", while the rest of us try to figure out the correct cocktail and combination of traits and behaviors so we can replicate it. 
but we can't. 
meantime, many of us just aren't charismatic and don't meet women easily or make and keep friends easily...and we have no idea why, and we'll likely never be able to change that. 
all in all, i wouldn't worry about yourself too much, my friend. i'm sure you're just fine how you are. you needn't be anything but who you feel you are, at heart. 
because someday, tomorrow or next week or in 20 years, you'll meet someone who falls in love with YOU, probably when you aren't looking or even trying. being yourself is what she'll fall in love with. so why alter it? you're depriving women of the real you.

394,"If one is in the throes of a depression, is riddled with debt, recently unemployed and the economic future is bleak for them - then the value of life is pretty low. (","&gt; My reasoning: I'm in good health, fairly young (41) and expect if I got it, which I don't know that I haven't already, I'll be down for a couple of days. 
Your position seems to be based on:
1. You're at physical advantage to fight off the virus. 
2. You struggle to see benefit in the ratio of risk to reward for yourself. 
3. You are not convinced by the anecdotes. 
4. In the above you make either and assumption or an inference that seems reasonable to you, that you'll be down for a couple of days if you contracted COVID-19 (when not vaccinated). 
I'll address these points above based on my own reasoning. No comment I make is intended to make an adverse comment about your person. 
There is an assumption that because you are young and fit that you will fight off the virus easily. That's true for loads of young people. Statistically you are at an advantage. But what are your estimates of risk? Is it just your life? The risk to life might be small but still what's your personal estimate for you. As you haven't stated it, I'll give a hypothetical. If someone says 'I estimate my risk of dying if I contract COVID, is no greater than 1%."" Whilst that is their business, what is the value they place on their life? How does one value living? If one is in the throes of a depression, is riddled with debt, recently unemployed and the economic future is bleak for them - then the value of life is pretty low. ( Please, this is a hypothetical - it's not you). 
If one had a wide portfolio of stocks and was now sitting on £4 Million in equity gains, just got married to the love of their life, and was about to retreat to an exotic resort in the Cook Islands - I dare say the value of their life to them is pretty upbeat. 
If one is in the middle of those extremes it might be 'Well, if I die from COVID, it not a problem. I've done most of what I wanted to achieve, in a humble and valuable life lived.' 
In other words, 'different courses for different horses.' The value of your life is what you make of it, and how you see the future. 
 But there is a problem. So far I've only been looking at life or death - two binary positions. Okay - so what about life after COVID infection with Long Covid or some other chronic illness that is COVID-related. One's youthfulness and productivity would be majorly lost. Life would be far from 'enjoyable'. The *risk* is not just about 'death'. It could be risk of a life with a debilitating illness. Some will have jumped on the net and relied on status up there for those sorts of things. COVID hasn't gone away as yet. The global death rate just crossed 3 million and  the global death rate has been accelerating. ( DYOR). Nobody truly knows what the true stats are on COVID-related illness. Why? Because the figures are not truly in as yet. Hence over the next year, what many will discover is that the COVID-related illnesses are probably much larger than the stats of today will show.  Your risk assessment - anybody's risk assessment - of contracting a COVID-related illness is therefore off the mark. 
There is a much wider perspective than just looking at one's individual risk of death or COVID-related illness. This is about the things and people beyond one's self. That's about other people. COVID spreads. What is known as rock solid is that human movement and interaction in groups are strongly correlated with spread. In the many illegal raves and house parties there were few if any people in the over 65s in attendance. The young(er) folk considered that they could shake it off, so they were bold. Folk over 50 were actually quite obedient of the rules, because they knew that it meant a higher probability of death or some chronic illness. 
In the big picture, is it fair for younger fitter people to spread virus around an put the lives of older people at risk (not to forget risk of Long Covid that may be caused to others)? I don't think so. Well I doubt that sort of thing was on the minds of rule breakers. Just to be clear I'm not talking about you. 
Considering the above things, having a vaccine shot at an individual level is well known to be a pretty good defence against the virus. I shan't be debating that. Being able to fight off the virus quickly (after vaccination) means less chance of death to the person infected, less chance of a COVID-related illness and less chance of spreading it around. But thinking beyond individuals, the positive effects of the vaccine means that less people nationally are likely to die and suffer with COVID-related health problems. That must be good for a Nation. It helps the economy recover, less unemployment, less people relying on State benefits, boost to real GDP, less chance of a serious economic crisis. In other words, we can get a fair way back as a Nation to a level that is better overall for everybody. 
I close by keeping it concise. Save your life and protect yourself against the underestimated risk of COVID-related illness. Save another person's life - and you won't know that person. Help save the economy and the Nation. If you're partially moved, just reach out and take that shot when it is offered.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,gv0m8vp,36,CMV

Can’t say it’s true everywhere but at least for my area it was pretty hot in terms of opportunities. 
Really depends on your area and interest.  For example Austin has alot of tech jobs but also has heavy competition.  And in reality most people are aiming for a very small subset of tech and other industries. 
So let's say there was, miraculously, 500k open jobs in tech in Austin and 500k people who wanted tech jobs.  Like 400k of the applicants would be fighting for 200k - 300k of the jobs.  So depending on whether you're looking for those high demand jobs or not your experience can drastically differ.

&gt; Not saying COVID is irrelevant. What you went through is absolutely terrifying but OP is referring to general job opportunities regardless of external environments like a public health crisis. 
My first stint and second stint were both around 2 years each and the first was pre-covid.  For my social media job my application was denied via one job board but I got an interview via the second and I had to get in touch with their HR and get my interview on track because the denial woulda blocked both of them.  I turned a shit situation into an advantage because they liked my tenacity and social skills.  Then in the interview I was knowledgable of the lingo the job due to my own self study that I did while working 60+ hours a week in my drafting job and then working graveyards at Hostgator. 
Heck even in my social media job to prepare for the career change I did about 20 hours a week of volunteer work while I was doing my social media job for about 9 months just to put it on my resume and that's a major part of why I got my current job. 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
So despite everything going tits up basically every step of the way (GD Murphy's law lol) I bit, clawed, and scratched my way into getting where I am.  Had I been less committed there are multiple points I'd have failed. 
Now the question becomes: should that be required?  And in my situation I think yes, that's reasonable.  I changed careers halfway through life.  A college kid has proof of knowledge (degree) but no proof of being a good worker, I had proof of good worker but no proof of knowledge.  I'm competing in a market against plenty of people who have both.  If I want to knock down that wall then I need to show the interviewers why I'm worth hiring over other people who may have a degree, more experience, or both. 
Fresh faced college kid faces the same conundrum. You have the paper saying you have the knowledge, you need to prove you can handle the job.  I don't like internships (because they tend to be unpaid) but they do well for that.  Likewise showing you can handle a service job only strengthens your degree.  It shows you can handle high pressure situations with grace for example, which is needed for many jobs.  So someone who crumples to a service job....they're actually prolly not suited for alot of high pressure industries.  It's all relevant.  It's not as simple as a dee gree, simple as 1 2 3, they're gonna hire me with a dee gree, 123 jobber you and me gurl.

&gt;I told my sister the covid numbers are inflated.","&gt;So I wont inject myself with a untested drug that isn't approved by the FDA. Make sense? 
What are you even talking about? Which vaccine available in the United States hasn't been tested? They have all gone through clinical trials with satisfactory results. EUA's don't change anything about the safety requirements needed for approval. 
The only difference between a EUA and Approval is in the effectiveness requirement. For an EUA, the FDA only needs to ""reasonably believe"" that the vaccine ""may be effective."" ( e.g., the Pfizer vaccine was given EUA based on an interm 91% effectiveness after phase 3 trials. When that result is finalized, the vaccine will be given full approval). 
The notion that any of the vaccines legally available to you are ""untested"" is actually just batshit. Where the hell did you even get this from? 
&gt;So your statement above is disingenuous. Because the general population weren't all offered it unrestricted access. 
Okay? How is my statement disingenuous? The FDA and CDC numbers that you're looking at are older than the current numbers I provided for the general population. Meaning they reached that level *before* the general population.

And even having all of these qualifications would not make you infallible. 
What's to stop anyone from countering your ""qualifications"" by saying that they have a B.S. in biochemistry and a PhD in microbiology and immunology?

&gt; I think you're arrogant for disrespecting our healthcare workers and the general knowledge of medicine and illness. 
I think you're significantly overestimating the knowledge that non-immunologists have about immunology. A pediatrician isn't an expert in neurology. An anesthesiologist doesn't need to know a whole lot about immunology. 
Also, ""healthcare professionals"" are not all doctors. Nurses, for example, do not have to be as knowledgeable about anything as doctors. 
It also seems like you aren't aware of the fact that an individual's experiences are not universal. Anecdotes cannot be used to prove broad claims like ""doctors don't want to be vaccinated,"" especially not when *actual data* contradicts the claim. 
Here's an example that you might understand better:
I can tell you that I have received the Pfizer vaccine and that I have not had *any* negative side effects. This wouldn't mean much to you for two major reasons:
(1) I could just be lying. 
(2) I am just one person. Not every person will react to the vaccine the same way that I did. I might be an outlier. I might have just gotten lucky. Etc. 
Apply this to your wife, now. I don't care if you say that she's a doctor because:
(1) You could be lying. 
(2) She is just one doctor. The hospital that she works in is just one hospital. Other doctors are going to have a different thought process and a different reaction to vaccination. Whatever she thinks and says is not representative of the entire healthcare industry. 
&gt;Ask yourself who is making most money off government funded vaccines? the drug companies. 
Okay? And this is relevant because? 
&gt;All of a sudden once a pandemic started some people believe they are angels. 
Lmao. Why are you making up strawmen to argue against? This just looks ridiculous. 
&gt;Here's some logic for you
Lol. 
&gt;Doctors prescribe drugs, surgeries and procedures...
Don't care. This is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand. I don't need to go to my GP to get a prescription for a vaccine lmao. 
&gt;I told my sister the covid numbers are inflated. 
Prove it. 
&gt;My sister was working on a patient in full PPE gear...
Another anecdote. What happened to the logic? 
&gt;The fact that it hasn't been through the FDA pipeline yet
Which vaccine legally available in the United States hasn't ""been through pipeline?"" 
&gt;every drug on the market right now has gone through the 4 steps the FDA has to have a drug on the market. the covid vaccines havent even been through that process yet. 
What are the four steps that these vaccines haven't been through? 
&gt;The vaccine hasnt been tested for safety yet bud
Which vaccine is legally avaialble in the United States and hasn't been tested for safety yet? 
&gt;Also if you have the vaccine you can still carry the virus AND pass it onto others. So you're not saving anyone but other vaccinated people. It doesn't ""slow the spread"". 
""If you obey traffic laws you may still hit and injure/kill someone with your vehicle. So you're not saving anyone...""
Evidence currently suggests that vaccination can decrease viral load in carriers and decreases transmission rates:

I still had the interest to understand why supporters of Trump though were so dead set that the election was rigged. While I cannot give evidence I believe I understand the logic that they are going through. 
Several factors to this election were pointed out to that likely caused more concerns than other elections, as well as just general people who support the person in power will accept his word. 
1. Mail In Voting: Definitely more widespread this year due to the global pandemic,  a lot of people are skeptical of these and especially with the Postal Service being messed with this year as well, it caused more trouble in many peoples minds. 
2. Turn outs in Biden supporting events: Biden was mocked fir having smaller rally s than Trump, due to him respecting COVID-19 guidelines as well as some areas in the country not being safe to put up support for Biden due to fear if retribution from MAGA supports. Thus mindsets could be given that they are simply more quiet than the loud and proud Trump supporters. 
3. Election numbers being higher than usual: Take into account the last point I made, of people seeing less support, but this election having record numbers of voters. Those seeing the other points being pointed out, voting restrictions, lack of active support, as proof that something shady was going on. 
4. Active Misinformation: Months before the election Trump had been strongly implying he had no doubt he would lose, he constantly kept his bravado till...still today. This is just the president mind you as well, its not supporters or the circumstantial evidence disproven or rejected by courts. The evidence that people threw up as proof the election was rigged many didn't read past the original headlines and kept that in mind. The other thing was many judges dismissed the cases before even hearing them out, which, while it was due to lack of evidence, was seen by many supports of what people saw as fraud as them ignoring the evidence as opposed to even giving it a fair chance. 
So there are lots of reasons why people may believe there is voter fraud. There ate a few points and likely I could write more, but while it may not change your view it may allow you to understand the perspective they come from and how their logic may be driven.

404,"If you remember the news stories, one of the big complaints about these vaccines was that they were not stable at fridge or room temperature conditions – because they are mRNA viruses, which do not replicate.","I apologize - I'm under a bit of a time crunch right now so this probably won't answer all of your questions but it's a start. 
To clarify, when I said ""healthcare professional"" I  was referring to the larger clinical center (so all staff, ranging from maintenance to nursing to MDs) but more specifically to my central sphere which is immunologists and virologists who are currently researching SARS-CoV-2. 
Based on the conversation so far, and similar ones that I’ve had with my own friends, I think it would be helpful to start with a description of what these vaccines really are. I’m assuming you are in the US so I will focus mostly on Moderna and Pfizer, but if there are others that you would like me to include please let me know. 
So first, an mRNA vaccine. You are correct that effective tissue delivery (i.e., getting an mRNA vaccine where it needs to go in one piece) has been a major b\*\*\*\* for the past several decades – not necessarily due to safety concerns, but definitely due to lackluster performance and because our immune system generally doesn’t like foreign genetic material in its neighborhood. Many of the major hurdles in getting FDA approval for these has not actually been about concerns for human life, but more that, well . . . they sucked. We’ll get more into that in a bit. 
Let’s talk types of vaccines. We’ve been working on how to safely boost our immune response to specific pathogens for a looooooong time, since before we found out that milkmaids weren’t getting smallpox. There are at least five major types of virus vaccines, and their effectiveness depends on where and how the pathogen replicates (makes more of itself), what parts of the virus are immunogenic (prompt your immune cells to say “hey! You don’t belong here – get out!”), how the virus gains a foothold in your body, or what parts of the virus actually make you really sick. For example, with an “inactivated virus”, you will get a dead version of that pathogen itself that has been rendered safe by boiling, acid, etc. This generally isn’t recognized by your immune system as being truly dangerous, so instead you might receive a “live attenuated virus”, which is a virus that has some limited capacity to make more of itself, but it’s been neutered so that it can’t really make you sick or do any significant damage. Scientists can also fashion a circular piece of DNA or a virus-like particle that will crank out viral proteins (vector vaccines). Beyond that, there are vaccines that directly deliver a specific protein or other part of the virus that laboratory tests have determined the immune system will recognize as “foreign” or “other” which are sufficient to either train the cells to respond to the pathogen directly, or can do so when delivered with other chemical compounds that ramp up these cells to a hyper-responsive state. All of these have a rich and varied clinical history and have been used to radically increase infant survival, minimize influenza deaths, eradicate smallpox, and largely eliminate polio from the world.  
The most recent vaccine formulation to come on the stage is the mRNA vaccine – so you are correct that it is \*relatively\* untested compared to the others. However, as I mentioned above, that is largely due to technical difficulties rather than larger concerns about their safety profile. I think they are also a little bit harder to grasp because understanding how an mRNA vaccine works requires a little bit more biology background than some of the other formulations; it’s relatively simple to think that a “dead” or “neutered” form of the bug can train our immune system to recognize the real thing, and we intuitively think that this mechanism is closer to the “natural” infection with the real thing.  
To understand how an mRNA vaccine works and why it might be safe or unsafe, we need a reminder of how DNA and RNA operate. To start at the beginning, DNA forms the building blocks for all living things: everything that our cells become and do is dictated by our DNA, which is compacted and coiled into chromosomes. Every cell and tissue of our body is ultimately formed from these instructions. However, this DNA sits silent unless it is read and understood by a specific protein called a polymerase, which translates these instructions into blueprints that can be implemented into the actual structures that become our nerve cells, muscles, etc. Specifically, polymerase translates DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA), which the ribosome (the “construction worker” of the cell) turns into the protein that performs the actual function. This is the canonical order of events: DNA to mRNA to protein is how the body is made and maintained. The important part of this is that mRNA is a \*secondary product\* that cannot propagate itself without the original DNA template. Once mRNA is made, it will persist in a cell as long as it is stable (anywhere from a few hours to a few days), then it will be chewed up and eliminated. 
In the case of an RNA virus like SARS-CoV2, it starts at the RNA stage and encodes its own special polymerase that uses RNA instead of DNA to make more of itself (called an “RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, or RdRP). So, for example, when it gets inside a lung cell it hijacks that cell’s cellular machinery to make that RdRp to exponentially increase its own growth and spill out into the surrounding area. The difference is that the vaccines have only the most immunogenic part of the virus’s mRNA (the spike), but it is provided to the cells \*without\* that RdRp, so that the cells that see the spike mRNA are incapable of making more of it. That means that the vaccine is self-limiting by its very nature. If you remember the news stories, one of the big complaints about these vaccines was that they were not stable at fridge or room temperature conditions – because they are mRNA viruses, which do not replicate. When we think of cancer, we think of something that is self-propagating: for example in Kaposi’s sarcoma, which is a known risk of HIV infection (my happy research place in non-COVID times), the immunosuppression that arises from HIV infection allows for rampant replication of the herpesvirus that activates oncogenic (cancerous) cell pathways. That cannot happen here. There is no significant concern for cancer or infertility here because there is no self-propagation – there is nothing remaining after the original injection that could cause long-lasting effects. This was actually cited as a potential strength of mRNA vaccines in 2018, \[since it was a “non-infectious, non-integrating platform, \[with\] no potential risk of infection or insertional mutagenesis” and that its “inherent immunogenicity of the mRNA can be down-modulated” by pharmacological methods\] ([https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243)). 
Another potential cause of concern is inflammation, which does occur just because our immune system recognizes the spike protein as a foreign bod and mounts a response against it. This is particularly strong in young and healthy cohorts, which may experience flu-like symptoms for 24-48 hours. The important thing to remember here is that this is a \*positive\* response that indicates your system is forming an immunological memory to the pathogen that will prevent or significantly diminish the foothold it gains when you are exposed to it in the future. Again, there is no significant concern for long-term effects here because symptoms resolve almost universally within 24-48 hours, so there is no risk of chronic inflammation that can be associated with cardiopulmonary or oncogenic effects. No significant adverse events beyond rare anaphylaxis have been reported from any mRNA vaccine, despite administration to \[over 51 million individuals to date\] ([https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-03-29/cdc-15-of-us-population-fully-vaccinated-against-coronavirus](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-03-29/cdc-15-of-us-population-fully-vaccinated-against-coronavirus)). In short, I can’t think of any long-term consequences from a non-replicating, transient immunization that would not be greatly amplified and worsened by exposure to the pathogen itself.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,gsvfkb8,39,CMV

The only rational (to me) reason for someone to claim to support something and then deliberately deleting an article that draws attention to the idea(s) you support is that their stance was virtue signaling and that they actually support the spread of misinformation. 
&amp;#x200B;
The 2nd part was in reference to the power mad way they reacted to my admittedly stupid and childish statement and the contradiction of their actions compared to their own sub rules.  Treating a single moment of stupidity as unacceptable while allowing hundreds of people to voice support of continued misinformation spreading that has provably cost people their lives. 
&amp;#x200B;
&gt;And not the actual issue, that you cant or havent identified what is and isnt misinformation. 
Ok then lets flip this around since you have apparently been ignoring all of my efforts.  Prove to me the following:
1. Masks do nothing to stop or reduce the spread of Covid. And any attempts to have a mask mandate for children in schools is child abuse because the mask will suffocate them.

It is about as bad as or not as bad as a flu for young children. 
Mind you, the flu is harder on kids than adults, the opposite is true for covid. 
What children are more vulnerable to than covid is the measures intended to slow the spread of covid. Suicide kills more kids than covid, and suicide rates for kids spiked during social isolation measures. 
Life has to go on at some point. And that point is when everyone has had a chance to have access to the vaccine. 
We will all die. That’s certain. What isn’t certain is if we will really live. That is up to us. This isn’t going away. It isn’t the worst health threat we are facing at the moment either. But it is the one we are disrupting our quality of life most to solve. At some point that stops making sense.

Herd immunity was not on the table for this disease according to the vast majority of experts since last spring.  It was always known it would be endemic. 
We are being dramatic with the “giving up our future” thing. Tuberculosis kills 1.5 million a year. We barely hear about it. Diarrhea kills about 2 million. And the deaths are one thing, but how much life has covid cost us? Shy of a life-week per capita last year. I for one am not willing to live a quality of life like last year again for an extra 1/52nd of quantity of life. Quality of life matters more than quantity of life for me. Living like that would be giving up my future.

418,"In the end, you'll still have the problems and the loved one you dump on is going to have the joy of their own problems, plus the trauma of having yours dumped on them as well.","Let me share some of my own experiences. I was badly abused throughout my childhood by my stepfather (physical, sexual, emotional, mental) AND my mother (she has undiagnosed BPD which has lead to emotional abuse, parentification, etc). 
I was also gay growing up in an uber-religious household. 
Because of this, I have CPTSD and suspected GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). 
My mother needs therapy for her very, VERY real mental illness that causes her to abuse those around her through parentification, depersonalization (of them), malingering, playing the victim, and her fear of abandonment. She, however, never sought out a therapist...she used ME as her therapist for literally decades. 
Guess what? She's still so bad in her mental illness that I have now cut all contact with her as has most of her family and hasn't changed *one bit*. She doesn't even see what she does as a problem, or hurtful or abusive to others because she doesn't see others as real people. 
We're talking thirty plus years of dumping her very bad problems on me and *nothing improved or changed*. Why? Because I am not a qualified therapist. Instead, my own problems only got worse because I was trying to deal with my own trauma AND hers/her justifications for traumatizing me. 
I, however, saw a therapist for three years. As a result, I was able to become comfortable and confident enough to come out of the closet, fall in love and get married to someone I actually wanted to marry, and recognize some patterns of my own toxic behavior that was a result of my trauma from my abuse. I was able to recognize my mother's abuse for what it actually was, gain enough self-love and self-confidence to take a stand and say I didn't deserve it, I deserved to be treated like a person and a daughter (instead of a non-person and a mother, by my own parent). 
As soon as COVID allows it, I plan on seeking out another therapist to help continue to deal with my CPTSD and continuing to strengthen my confidence, and work through my abuse and trauma so that I can stop being so anxiety riddled all the time, stop having terrible nightmares and flashbacks to my abuse, and get the tools I need to stop the pattern of toxicity with me so that it doesn't land on my wife or other important people in my life. 
None of my friends or immediate family are qualified to help me do that, and they all have their lives to carry without having to carry mine as well. I won't do to them what my mother did to me, because what she did to me *did not help her* and *only hurt me*. 
Therapy works. Opening up about your problems to a stranger who is qualified to treat you and give you the tools to navigate and unravel those problems helps you and doesn't damage them. Opening up about your problems to a friend or loved one who is NOT qualified to treat you or give  you any tools to unravel those problems only makes you feel momentarily better at the cost of them feeling worse.

419,So even in the perfect testing schedule (aka— you get tested the second you wake up every morning and do not interact with the public at all until you get your results) you will **still** be spreading the virus unknowingly for 24-48 hours at a minimum.,"Okay so the fact that you and your whole staff at work got it despite being vaccinated should be a good enough reason to not want to “just open up and let those who refuse to get vaccinated deal with the repercussions”— because they aren’t the only ones who will deal with the repercussions. 
Your personal experience with COVID after getting vaccinated doesn’t mean it’s the experience of everyone who’s suffered through a breakthrough infection. I know someone dealing with a breakthrough infection right now and it does NOT sound fun (for reference, he’s in his late 20’s and in really good health). On top of that, we don’t really know what the long term health impacts of actually getting covid might be. Maybe you didn’t feel anything while you were sick, but for all we know, it could end up contributing to something like heart failure in the long run. 
With that said, asymptomatic spread (aka, spreading the disease before you even test positive for it) is no less than 2 days for the original variant &amp; (projected to be) just over a day with the delta variant (but with the delta variant, you are MUCH more contagious). So even in the perfect testing schedule (aka— you get tested the second you wake up every morning and do not interact with the public at all until you get your results) you will **still** be spreading the virus unknowingly for 24-48 hours at a minimum. 
On top of that, there are people who, for whatever reason, can’t get vaccinated or already have compromised immune systems, so the vaccine might not work as well on them, and I’m pretty sure children under age 12 still cannot get vaccinated. Each vaccinated person who works in an environment similar to you and has regular contact with the (half vaccinated, half unvaccinated) that contracts the virus has a huge chance of going home and spreading it to their family unknowingly for 24-48 hours without having symptoms or even testing positive. That family could consist of teachers, healthcare workers, elder care workers, children under the age of 12, people with compromised immune systems, people who also work with the public, etc. THEN, the members of said family could spread it to everyone else they interact with for the next 24-48 hours without knowing (again, I’m assuming perfect testing conditions where you get tested every single day and don’t interact with anyone outside of your family until you get your results for the day. Even in this situation, it can leap from person to person for 24-48 hours). 
In terms of “at what point to we return to normal life?” I don’t know, but maybe when COVID isn’t the 3rd leading cause of death in our country. Also, herd immunity is a real thing, and it doesn’t require a 100% vaccination rate. We just need to get to a high enough level that the spread is controllable— some say that level is around 75%-80%, some argue it should be closer to 90%. Either way, we’re not there yet, and I do find it kind of ridiculous to suggest that we should just give up, let hospitals get overwhelmed and let more people (even those who got vaccinated) die because of other peoples stupidity.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,hcofslz,56,CMV
420,"If they don't have that, they will forget so much instruction that it will be impossible to simply restart where they left off.","I don't think we should decide now that school be suspended for an entire year.  I agree reopening in the fall is not safe, but staying closed the entire year would mean they don't have school until June.  By then, there could very well be a vaccine for Covid-19 that most of the population can get.  I've heard projections for a vaccine as early as December.  If that is the case, schools could probably safely reopen around February at the latest.  And if states get sufficient contact tracing in place to make sure they can trace all suspected cases.  This seems to be happening in Massachusetts.  It should happen nationwide.  
I also disagree that we should not have online learning at all.  I agree it can't supplement in person learning, however that doesn't mean it can't help at all.  For elementary school students, they can watch videos on concepts to help them not fall behind too much.  The teacher can also do some lectures over Zoom.  I agree with you that it shouldn't be four hours a day.  I agree elementary school students won't be able to sit through that.  It should be one hour a day maybe for elementary school students.  For middle school students, I think they're teachers can do Zoom lectures, but not for the length of a typical school day.  Maybe it can be half the length?  I feel like kids could sit through this possibly.  You seem to be saying that any schooling at all makes being at home more stressful to students, but I disagree.  They are likely board out of their minds at home.  They can't have extracurricular activities either.  Having some limited schooling may help prevent them from getting too bored.  For high school students,  I feel like Zoom lectures can fully replace in person lectures.  High Schoolers are mature enough to drive in most cases.  It seems like a stretch to say they are not mature enough to keep up with online school.  I do agree however that schoolng during a pandemic is stressful, which is why I think a pass/no pass grading option should be available to high school students in all their classes.  This reduces the stress of having a high GPA.  
You argue that online learning is more stressful for teachers, which I agree with, however I don't think that means it should not be done at all.  Everyone's work is more stressful due to the pandemic.  Healthcare workers go without saying.  Restaurant and store workers' work is way more stressful because they have to make sure that there are no ways to spread coronavirus in the restaurants.  Anyone who works at an office job and can no longer go in and has to work online has more stressful work.  Business executives figuring out how to move all their workers online have more stressful work.  None of these professions are given a break because their work is stressful. Why shouldn't it be the same with teachers? 
Even if school is suspended for a year, kids still need some sort of academic instruction during that year.  If they don't have that, they will forget so much instruction that it will be impossible to simply restart where they left off.  This is why some form of online instruction is necessary.  If school really has to be closed for the entire school year, kids should not advance in grade level at all during that year.  So someone who would have graduated 2025 would now graduate in 2026.  However even if this happens, kids would need some sort of online instruction to make sure they don't forget what they've learned.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,g0hck6a,27,CMV

But I think we can both on agree on where I was coming from- the idea that our body and brain has, through evolution, been fine-tuned to deal with a lifestyle completely different from modern life. Evolution is far too slow to keep up with our own technological advancements. We have been, in essence, constantly updating the software while the hardware mostly stays the same. That's really what I was getting at...   
The problem was I then jumped to the conclusion that that somehow makes life as an early human preferable to what we have now, or that the wonderful technology we have made for ourselves is inherently a bad thing. It is a bad thing in certain cases, and I can point to the modern American diet to prove that (I'm talking mostly about junk food and other poison we've been taught to consume). There's a mass obesity epidemic and that certainly isn't making anyone healthier or happier. There are other things, too, of course. As soon as society changes from being a means of helping people to being a means of making money and exploiting the general population... That's when society is a bad thing.

I've had 5 serious relationships (+9 months) in my life. Of those 5, 2 have been online and 3 via social activities. I literally joined a sports league and ended up dating one of my team mates. Social events (post Covid) still and always will exist and are not taken away by the concept of dating apps.

And depending on the situation, one might not have chosen risk over certainty. Let me elaborate. 
For example (and I apologize in advance for the crude analogy), if there's a really crowded pool and I *know* there's a non-zero chance of getting pregnant from swimming in this pool because it happened once to someone else (but I want to swim anyways), am I allowed to abort if I *do* get pregnant from this pool? Or any pool? I would hope so, since there's *always* going to be a non-zero chance: I may not know whether there's a zero on this roulette or none at all, but there was a zero on *someone's* roulette, and I definitely *chose* to spin it, because what's a life without swimming? 
For a less crude example that doesn't involve pregnancy: Currently I wear a facemask to reduce the possibility of getting covid and potentially take a respirator from someone else who needs it. Normally, I take very drastic measures to mitigate against this risk, like ordering food online to minimize human contact. Occasionally, I would like to cook food- but this involves going to the grocery store, which is riskier than not. Am I responsible for taking someone's life if I catch covid and take a respirator from someone else, even though I did the best I could to otherwise minimize the risk (wearing a mask, goggles, washing hands, etc.)? 
I think unprotected sex is definitely risky- knowing it's risky and doing it when you don't want a kid is asking for trouble. If I knowingly didn't take precautions, I wouldn't say I chose to be pregnant, but made a decision that risked pregnancy *and* I chose risk over certainty. On the other hand, taking all the precautions and getting pregnant anyways is categorically different: I didn't choose to be pregnant *and* I didn't choose risk over certainty, but I made a decision that risked pregnancy. 
Same applies to the other two examples with swimming and going to the grocery store: I didn't choose the undesired consequence and I didn't choose risk over certainty, but I knowingly made a decision that nonetheless risked an undesirable consequence.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,gagyn7i,74,CMV

Maybe that was because people were not taking the lockdown seriously and the virus still spread. You cannot blame the government for that. Also, it is a new disease, so it takes a while to figure out just how infections the virus is. Then there are the variants (like the current Delta variant) that are MUCH more infectious, so previous measures may not be enough for that. If the virus changes, then so too must the measures to protect yourself. It stands to reason. 
&gt; then we get told “no masks” then masks, then 2 masks. 
The ""no masks"" advice was correct when the risks of meeting anyone in the country with the virus was extremely low at the start. At the same time, there was a shortage of masks for healthcare workers, who needs were greater because they would be in contact with covid patients. 
Finally, the ""2 masks"" was never an official recommendation. It was simply an answer to a journalist who asked whether two masks would provide more protection. The day after the interview, the CDC clarified that it was not their advice. 
What is the government supposed to do? Should they overreact in the first place? No, because that will raise the ire of the anti-covid crowd as being unnecessary. Should they stick to the original measures? No, because then they are not doing enough to stop the spread.

&gt;this is the first mRNA vaccine I’ve ever heard of
Sure, this is the first vaccine I’m aware of too which uses mRNA tech. But as others have said, mRNA tech isn’t new. Covid just pushed it forward and led to the production of a product.

Completely agree. But. You forgot the point that instead of YOU completing a project that would normally take a week in a day, your manager has assigned you a team of fifteen people to speed up your work and get it done within the day. 
Covid has united the world to get these vaccines out.

If he got the vaccine on top of that, he carries the risk of autoimmunity. 
We do not know exactly how much protection antibodies may provide or how long this protection may last. There have been people who have had anti-bodies and gotten sick again. 
&gt;Number 2: Children are at almost ZERO risk to this disease. I mean the number of children who have had COVID and died is tiny. Also, around 84% of elderly people are vaccinated, which takes care of a lot of risk right there. 
Didn't say they would necessarily die. Children can get sick and they can experience mild to severe complications; these include fever,  fatigue, respiratory failure, and myocarditis. Bear look like if you can track the virus, but there is still a present possibility and I think that is to take in consideration. ( As of April 19th told you were making up nearly 21% of new covid-19 cases). 
&gt;You are forgetting anti-bodies. People have immunity from anti-bodies. Also, case and hospitalization rates have been crashing everywhere, if you haven't noticed. 
This is not definitive as people who have gotten anti-bodies have contracted virus again.  Secondly, going on the idea that antibodies cause an increased chance of not contracting, instead of a definitive chance of not contracting, the CDC does not know exactly how long antibodies provide protection for.

430,"In any case, Palestinians protested the evictions and Israel decided that the appropriate response was to raid one of the holiest sites in Islam during fucking Ramadan.","&gt;See? The publicity is working.  You're blaming Israel for blowing it up, instead of blaming Hamas for being there to begin with. 
This is because I don't typically believe the excuses given by the IDF. I don't for example, believe that the building housing the Associated Press in Gaza was also a secret Hamas lair. Given the IDF's extensive history of engaging in collective punishment against Palestinians, I don't see why on earth I should take their word for it. 
That said, I was actually incorrect on this one! It turns out Israel was just blowing up a nearby building and happened to destroy a children's charity and the only covid clinic serving a population of millions. Cool cool cool. 
&gt;Okay. Collateral damage is to be expected. It sucks that it happens. But at least the Israelis are trying to limit their responses to legitimate targets, even if they miss occasionally. This is much much better than indiscriminately shooting rockets at civilian populations like Hamas does. 
The word occasionally is going to win a gold medal in weight lifting at this rate. 
And no, I'd disagree entirely. Israel is indiscriminately shooting and bombing a civilian population center, and doing so with very powerful targeted munitions. Even if I believed that they were doing their best to avoid collateral damage (they aren't), I don't feel that they should get a pass because they are merely incompetent at keeping civilian damage and casualties to a minimum. 
I guess I'm just a utilitarian at heart. Is hamas shooting rockets knowing they have no control over their targets and are likely to hit civilian centers somehow better than Israel  ostensibly targetting Hamas knowing full well they are going to hit civilian centers somehow better? 
If I shoot a hundred rockets and one of them hits a house, is that somehow worse than you shooting a missile out of an f-16 and leveling an apartment building? 
I care more about results, and the result is israel killing hundreds and blowing up large chunks of a city, knowing full well the results that are going to happen, even if they clutch their pearls and try to act like it is unavoidable. 
&gt;This... is a circular argument. Palestinians hate Jews. Palestinians attack Jews. Jews strike back. Which makes Palestinians hate the Jews more. It's a vicious cycle, an infinite loop. The only way out (barring external intervention) is for the Palestinians to stop attacking. Then Israel can stop responding. 
Remind me, why did this most recent bout start? 
Oh yeah, Israeli settlers continued with a fairly long held tradition of evicting Palestinians in East Jerusalem and r eplacing them with Israeli settlers. This is an intentional policy, designed to make it harder and harder for any future peace settlement to include east jerusalem on the palestinian side. Simply put, if you keep evicting people and replacing them with settlers, eventually the population of the city will be more jewish than palestinian and the Israelis can go ""Well why should we give up this city when our people live here?!"" 
And before you argue ""Well they are being legally evicted"" keep in mind that it is the Israeli government (you know, the people trying to force them out) who wrote and enforce the laws you'd be appealing to. Has a certain circularity to it, no? 
In any case, Palestinians protested the evictions and Israel decided that the appropriate response was to raid one of the holiest sites in Islam during fucking Ramadan. 
Perhaps, and just hear me out, If Israel would stop trying to ethnically cleanse jerusalem and would stop shooting up peaceful protesters Palestinians might be less inclined to violence. 
As I said in my OP, everyone sucks here, but to act as if Palestinans are the problem and not their oppressors is just absurd.",1,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,gypk2xh,30,CMV
431,"Most Americans support the ""for the people act"" (the voting rights bill) and there was even leaked audio of a republican meeting where they admitted most Republican voters like that bill when you just explain it unbiased.","The problem with the ""United States"" is that state lines are arbitrary. We have two dokatas specifically because politicians in the 1800's saw that they could exploit the fact that each state regardless of population gets two senators. I am still very upset that as a Californian, I am incredibly underrepresented in federal government. The senate is the compromise, and the Dems technically won that too. 
As for the infrastructure plan, we'll see. There are more than one example of Republicans meeting with Dems during Obama's terms, agreeing on a bill, and then still voting it down because making the Dems look bad was top priority. Also, responding to Biden's 2.1 trillion bill (who again won with a HUGE mandate in my opinion, in both popular vote, electoral votes, and Georgia sending two den senators after knowing Biden won and that his plan would need more dems) with a quarter of that amount isn't really something I think the minority party should be allowed to do. I mean, yes they can, but that doesn't seem like a honest attempt at compromise. Again, we'll see, but they already negotiated with Dems about the Jan 6th commission and then filibustered it anyways. You haven't commented on that yet, and I'm curious what you think about that. 
Did pelosi and Schumer ever come out in 2016 and say ""Our top priority for the next 4 years is making Trump a one term president"" because unless I missed that, they don't seem comparable. They might have said they will oppose Trump's policies and try and stop them, but with republicans winning the trifecta in 2016 I would have been fine with letting them govern since that is what the American people wanted at the time. 
Republicans own the majority of state legislatures because they have states with a smaller population than my California highschool (hyperbole, but you get the point. Also edit to say I'm not a student, I'm a teacher. Math/physics). Dems do too with some small new England states, but the vast majority of states that are small population States are Republican safe States. Again, this is why I'm upset with the senate being doubly biased towards the minority. I live in LA county, a population of about 10mil. Wyoming, with a population of 700k or so, has more representation with less than a 10th of the people. And the fact that most small rural states are Republican already gives the minority a huge boost in politics. I don't think they also need the filibuster. 
To conclude, I agree we need to protect the minority, but not at the expense of the majority. Most Americans support Biden's infrastructure bill. Most Americans support the ""for the people act"" (the voting rights bill) and there was even leaked audio of a republican meeting where they admitted most Republican voters like that bill when you just explain it unbiased. Most Americans supported Biden's COVID response. Most Americans wanted a Jan 6th investigation. But because a minority of Americans are overrepresented in the Senate, and Congress needs a super majority to get anything done because of the filibuster, the majority can kick rocks. I don't think that's fair and will be the downfall of our democracy since Republicans stopped operating in good faith. You have republicans who were caught on camera helping block doors to stop the mob from getting in on Jan 6th coming out today and saying ""Oh it was just a tour group that got a bit routy."" They don't care anymore, and if the filibuster continues to exist in it's current form (I'd be willing to try the talking filibuster as a compromise, but won't hold my breath on that fixing the issues I see), they will just do a repeat of the Obama years. Block everything, even their own legislation (yes they did this during Obama's terms), because most Americans will blame the president and the party they come from. 
We might just have a fundamental difference on our beliefs. To me, if a single party controls both houses of Congress and the presidency, they should be allowed to do basically all of their [constitutional] legislation. That is exactly in line with what the founding fathers wanted since that's how they wrote the Constitution. If the American people don't like it, they will vote somebody else in next time. That cannot be worse than a government that does nothing while 500k Americans die from COVID or sits back and watches as our infrastructure completely crumbles. I'll read your response to this, but I don't think I'll debate anymore since the difference seems to be a core difference in how we think the country should run.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,h0li0fo,42,CMV

This is the first widespread mRNA vaccine, so I'm guessing there *may* be unknown risks that we haven't foreseen yet, although as others have pointed out, we have been studying these vaccines for years and this is just the first big one. But even if the risk of the vaccine was higher than the risk of the oral polio vaccine, I'd get it (I did get it actually and I got my kids the oral polio vaccine because we were in a polio endemic country). 
Why? ** Because the benefit is** ***no COVID.*** Unless you are a conspiracy theorist, and you say you aren't, there is no reason to believe that COVID is not one of the deadliest, most painful viruses to sweep the planet in over 100 years. 
It's infected nearly 10% of the population in the United States. * Ten percent is really bad odds.* 
Is there a small risk with any treatment? Yes. Do I fully understand the risks of the COVID vaccine? Not any more than any other vaccine. 
But holy shit, COVID is for real. Here are some stories:  [COVID-19 Changed Everything: 3 Personal Stories (webmd.com)](https://blogs.webmd.com/my-experience/20201223/covid-19-changed-everything-3-personal-stories)  I know people who have been hospitalized with the flu. This is a whole other ballgame. 
The *worst* reported side effects from the mRNA vaccines are less severe than a *mild* case of COVID (obviously not worse than asymptomatic COVID). 
There may be minor, unknown risks involved involved in, say, using a seatbelt. What if it malfunctions? What if it is not adjusted right? But flying through a windshield, holy shit. 
That's why I don't think it's unwise to get the vaccine. 
The only exception would be if you are prone to vaccine reactions or have a lot of allergies. But even then, I know people who did it because with their health conditions, COVID would be worse. And it's much more likely.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,gw8p3jr,43,CMV

And this applies to any opinion expressed by any human. How is this different? 
&gt;A lot of people believe in it because it’s a trend. 
Or are more people *aware* of it because it's a trend? 
&gt;All of a sudden a new hashtag comes along and everyone comes out of the woodwork to post their picture and then disappears for half a year until the next batch of outrage. 
Are there other nationwide protests and riots in America happening more frequently than every 6 months that I am not aware of? 
&gt;It’s human nature to blindly follow a crowd and want acceptance (ironically what we’re seeing with the protest violence). 
Is that what we're seeing with protest violence? Or are people just really, really angry? 
There's a commonality in all of your opinions: they require your own personal biases to be true in order to be logically consistent. There are multiple explanations for every piece of behaviour you've listed, but because you hold the following to be absolute:
1) People don't really care about police brutality. 
2) Rioters are just following a crowd and aren't really angry
3) Companies and public figures *only* express solidarity for free money. 
4) If people aren't posting to social media about somthing, then they don't care about it. 
However, these are all just assumptions that you cannot prove, based on your own singular personal bias: you don't really agree with their reasons for protesting. If you can truly see *no reason* for them to be behaving the way they do other than lying for internet points, then I don't see how your view can be changed. 
&gt;There have been plenty of unarmed black people killed in the past and none of my peers have piped up. 
Then get new peers? Idk what to tell you, man. 
I have a colleague who posted the black square. He hasn't posted anything social justice-y ever before - but we discuss these sorts of issues every day and he is passionate about them. 
So why now? He says there is something about this particular moment in time, with the protests, and the rioting, the militarised response, and COVID, and the Trump Presidency, that tells him that American culture is at a breaking point. Something about 2020 feels make-or-break to him for society. That this moment in time is uniquely important. I feel this way too. So he felt compelled to show his support.

437,I bought it for $50 and sold it to you for $100 - nothing new was created. I just extracted money $50 by selling it for more than I bought it for.,"&gt; a. a painting is a physical product (vs shares which are virtual), which implies that the frequency of trading is lower and that the chain of ownership is shorter (as you can’t exchange the same painting millions of times every day). 
Shares of a company can very much be a physical item. You are just used to thinking of a share as a 'virtual' item. 
&gt;b. selling paintings and other goods has a value add 
No not really. I bought it for $50 and sold it to you for $100 - nothing new was created. I just extracted money $50 by selling it for more than I bought it for. 
&gt;About HFT – I agree with what you’re saying but I don’t see how it shows the benefit. I would speculate that you actually agree that HFT is not very beneficial but you’d need extra regulation. 
I do agree it is not necessarily beneficial. The question of added regulations makes me ask what the cost is for those regulations. What do they add by restricting the market. 
&gt;Share buyback – Yes, the owners will surely decide but that doesn’t mean the money is not better spent on e.g. R&amp;D or paying the employees more or lowering environment impact
But you don't get it. The owners of the company are the ones who decide what is in the best interest of the company. They make that call - not you. 
Think smaller. An accounting firm of 4 CPA's. One retires. Rather than selling that 'share', the company buys out that retiring CPA. That is what a buyback of stock is. You are mandating that they have another CPA buy in. 
&gt;Ex-dividend – One alternative would be to have a minimum time of ownership. If I really want to &lt;invest&gt; in a company, I have to be able to hold onto their shares for say one week. 
What happens if a share is not held long enough? Nobody gets the dividend? 
Why is this even an issue to you? It is a company stating, well in advance I might add, how they determine the owner of record is for dividend payments. 
The person who sold the stock knew they could have held it one more day to get the dividends but choose to sell it. You cannot just 'buy stock' on that day because you want to. Someone *has to sell it*. Somebody made the choice to forgo those dividends by selling. 
&gt;Public announcements – agree that insider trading is regulated. But certain tweets from certain presidents, which have massive impact, haven’t been investigated. Plus the whole concept of reaction to news, which drives prices because of the algorithmic nature of most trades, seems a bit fishy to me. 
Nothing is perfect. I wouldn't pick on the POTUS first though. Congress is a better place to look for insider trading violations. There are several currently being looked at with the COVID-19 situation. 
&gt;To conclude, I think we agree on more points than we disagree but I don't think your comment proves any benefit of the stock market. 
It was not trying to. You are complaining about how it works and wanting to ascribe benefits to society for it. That is just not correct. 
It works the way it works because the people involved set it up with this framework to allow the buying and selling of ownership stakes in companies. None of the 'benefits' you claim are important are actually core missions of the stock market. Its sole purpose is to allow the trading of ownership stakes in companies. 
It frankly does not care about 'society', 'income inequality', or 'efficient allocations of capital'. That is not something it was ever designed to do.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,fnilwnt,37,CMV

441,"Well, I received an email from Moderna a few days ago thanking me for participating in their trial. Moderna changed their plans a lot during the trials. They were unsure how to proceed and they kept changing schedules for appointments and unblinding test subjects. They were undecided about a booster shot but it now seems like they are recommending it. Perhaps after I take the flu shot this year I will take the booster shot. The trial was supposed to last 2 years and I only participated for almost a year. I guess they don't really need me anymore and have already concluded their research on the vaccine's efficacy.","Its cool that I can actually weigh in on this one:
I was part of Moderna's Phase-III MRNA vaccine trial last year. I signed up for it and received compensation for the administration of two shots of the vaccines, reporting any symptoms in my e-diary, and regular office visits to have my blood drawn. The Phase-III trial included 30,000 volunteer participants in which they would be administered either the vaccine or a placebo (sodium chloride, AKA salt). It was a 1:1 ratio, meaning for each *one* person who received the vaccine one other person would receive the placebo so out of 30,000 individuals participating in the trial, only 15,000 would receive the vaccine. It was literally a coin toss, a 50/50 chance of getting the shot. 
Luckily for me I beat the odds twice and I got the first shot in September and the second one in October 2020. Here were the symptoms:
\- Fever
\- Lethargy
\- Headache
\- Joint pain on my left hand
The symptoms were mild on the first shot. And once your immune system was trained to fight the virus, the symptoms were stronger on the second shot but nothing alarming other than feeling really sick for two days. I'll take two days over two weeks with life-threatening symptoms and a possible ventilator any day, plus propagation to elderly, disabled and children. I'm sure COVID-19 would've fucked me up if I got the actual virus. 
You see, what they are administering in your body is actually a *spike protein* of the virus located on the surface of the virus. So instead of administering an attenuated (weakened) version of the virus or extracting a strain from an egg like the flu shots, they did this instead, resulting in not only weaker symptoms that last less time but also *a more broad immunity against the virus and possible variants.* From my experience the vaccine was a huge success and Moderna confirmed it had a 94.5% efficacy. It would be very difficult for the virus to break through it. 
Also, and this is going to raise a few eyebrows, Moderna was *explicitly* looking for Latino and Hispanics in the vaccine trial. And what happened after the vaccines were administered by October? Moderna proceeded to distribute the vaccines in Puerto Rico, which gives me reason to believe that they wanted to experiment on minorities first and then jump ship if the vaccine was a failure. That way white people would be spared the possible pain that their cannon fodder Puerto Rican counterparts may have possibly experienced and therefore not lose any American clients, but that's just me speculating. 
But let's assume my conspiracy theory happens to be correct. In Puerto Rico the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine were very well tolerated so fortunately for us we got the vaccine *before any other state*. In fact, my family was hesitant like everyone else about the vaccine but after seeing how I responded to the vaccine they jumped right in without a second thought. As a result: everyone in my family has been vaccinated and I saved their lives from COVID-19. 
Also, the MRNA-style vaccine has been in development for about a decade but this isn't any other vaccine: this is actually a new level of vaccination achieved by different companies. They wanted a broad-spectrum vaccine that could target several variants, which works perfectly against a steadily-mutating virus like COVID-19. 
As a result of Moderna's success this company is beginning vaccine trials for different types of vaccines, the MRNA HIV vaccine has already cleared Phase 1. 
As for me? Well, I received an email from Moderna a few days ago thanking me for participating in their trial. Moderna changed their plans a lot during the trials.

Eh only liberals and leftists support candidates and not policies. Take Cuomo for example. Killing 30,000 grandparents by putting covid patients in retirement homes, using state resources to write his book, and targeting the Jewish community in covid enforcement were all ignored or justified as just republican attacks. It literally took him stalking and groping and harassing women and then using his position to punish those who spoke up to lose support. 
&gt;Congress couldn't prevent evictions as Republicans would have filibustered it. 
Bc it was anticonstitutional and essentially seizing control over the entire rental industry. The republicans would have been receptive if the Dems wouldn't keep using every single crisis to sneak through non related policy like gun control measures in the infrastructure bill. Make a one page bill and the republicans would likely have passed it but it still would likely be ruled unconstitutional via the supreme court. 
&gt;I'm largely ignoring the rights conspiracy theories about Pelosi. 
I'm sure you are. It's hardly conspiracy theory. Everything I listed was proven or is easily deduced. 
&gt;The reason absolutely matters. BLM fights for a group that is actually being attacked, Trumps supporters were using violence to impose their views on the country at large. 
Attacked you say? Hmmm convenient framing. How exactly is burning down police stations with cops inside while welding doors shut and yelling fry them like bacon helping? 
&gt;America doesn't have racial equality. Racism is now banned but the legacy of it (vast difference of wealth, under investment in majority black areas) continues to hold minorities back today. Imagine stealing from someone for decades and then saying ""Right, from now on, no stealing. Let's just move on."" and expecting that person to be OK with you keeping what you stole. They also are still victim to racism through police violence. 
America does have racial equality with the sole exception of affirmative action. It has not achieved racial equity or equality of outcome. What's holding back minorities is the democrats welfare policies destroying families and encouraging single motherhood which is the absolute biggest predictor of failing to succeed. This is one of the only differences between AA and Asians, Italians, Irish, Jews, and other races discriminated against but having lower rates of single motherhood. Every race is affected by police violence but oddly police shooting white people (which happens twice as often) never makes the news unless a women is involved. We have a police brutality problem and a crime problem in predominantly black and brown inner city problem not necessarily a racial discrimination problem. 
&gt;Everything you said in the last paragraph was vague. None of that is government policy. A large portion of Republicans don't want many of the rest of that 300 million people to be allowed to vote. How on earth can anyone represent them all? 
No republican is against people legally voting. They just want to make sure each vote is legal. It is extremely hard to investigate and confirm fraud and this is made even harder without safeguards in place. The only real way to address potential fraud is to prevent it through reasonable voter rules and registration. 
Interestingly in 2015 the supreme court ruled that the states had full control over the voting process except for one area. Can you make a wild guess at what that one area was? That's right they have control over any issues of group discrimination and racism. Weird how right after that ruling, everything started to be about racism and discrimination, huh? The Dems started supporting BLM and CRT which both claim systematic racism which oddly would give them claim to take federal control over the voting process. I'm just saying it's rather convenient timing. It's also odd that during a pandemic that their first piece of legislation after gaining a majority was HR1 which was the attempt to federalize the voting process under the claim the entire system was discriminatory and needed to be federalized. Very odd priorities, just saying.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,h84twyl,55,CMV

I've  read that most Americans want tighter gun controls.  Politicians supported by the gun lobby and rightwing  media  prevent it. 
Compulsory voting works pretty well here. It's  a compulsion to turn up and get your name marked off at the polling booth. You don't  have to formally  vote, but 90% do. It forces  them to take some degree of interest in the system that governs them. We think that makes for a healthier democracy  when you have massive participation.

H1-B seems to be more ""corporations first, maybe the H1-B recipient benefits, but fuck everyone else except our profit margins""

What brutal measures post-1945 were taken? Who was resisting on the German side after their political leadership had accepted the unconditional surrender? Sure Nazis were thrown out of office, but so were Taliban in Afghanistan as well. 
&gt;Continue half measures in a vain hope the central Afghan Government would step up to the plate. 
So, what would have been the ""full measures"" that were done in Germany 1945-1949 that were not done in Afghanistan in 20 years? By 1949 FRG had already been established and its government elected by the German people. 
&gt;That's not a 'Hearts and Minds"" conversation. 
I can understand that by brutality Taliban could keep the local population from collaborating with the US, but the question I'm asking why did the locals join Taliban who was threatening to kill their families? So, when the US military might demolished Taliban forces time after time in battle, where did they get new soldiers if hearts and minds were on the side of the US/Afghan government? 
&gt;Now add in the tribal and religious aspects. ( Your local elder/imam says you fight the Americans? Well shit, guess we're fighting the Americans.) 
So, the main question is still, why does the local elder say that you should fight the Americans and not the Taliban who is threatening to kill everyone? 
Furthermore, if the hearts and minds to Afghan people go through the elders, then why not engage them and convince them to be on your side? You'd think that it would be obvious, if that's how the Afghan society works. 
&gt;Tribal leadership is life there. 
Ok, why were the tribal leaders on the side of the Taliban if they had been horrible to the people in the past 5 years? Or let's put it this way, where did the mandate of the tribal leaders' power come from if they were seen as supporting the side that people hated? 
&gt; You can never stop an insurgency's recruitment. Because they are able to make propaganda with video editing. 
Of course you make your own propaganda to match theirs. Does the US military suck so bad at video editing that they can't make better videos than some low tech insurgents at the mountains? 
Furthermore, how long people believe in the propaganda if they see their own eyes what is going on? What I mean is that if you see your family blown to bits in an air strike on a wedding party, then you might listen to the Taliban propaganda. If that never happens and instead it's the Taliban bombs that keep killing your relatives, then why would you join them? 
&gt;Now add in the death-cult and martyrdom portion of the religion. Losing IS winning. 
Again, I ask, if this was known beforehand, then what was the point of the whole war? If the US knew that no matter how many Taliban fighters they would kill, more would come to replace them, then what's the point of staying there? So, even if Afghan government had done everything right with zero corruption, if Taliban can recruit people that easily by saying:"" just come to die in jihad and you'll go straight to Paradise"" then why even bother? 
&gt;The US offered them a better life tomorrow. 
  

  
The Taliban offered them living until tomorrow. 
So, which one would you choose to join if you were a young Afghani man? 
Furthermore, you're now undermining your own earlier comment saying that people actually collaborated with the US forces telling them where the bombs were. So, I find it strange that if they were told that they will be killed if they do that (and the US forces are incapable of protecting them from that) they would not be scared to do that, but at the same time they would keep joining in numbers to the side who threatened to kill their families. 
&gt; Every country knows the impossibility of fighting an insurgency. 
It's not. There are countless examples from history, where the insurgencies have been suppressed. Not every insurgency succeeds. For instance, look at the countries that the Soviets occupied after WWII. Pretty much all of them had insurgencies against the communist rule, but they were suppressed. Look at the US itself. It had a bunch of states leaving the union in 1861. Their rebellion was crushed and they were brought back to union. 
So, clearly it's possible to win against the insurgents, unify country and return to peace. It's hard to do that if the people of the country don't want you there, but that is the main question. Why wouldn't the Afghans want the US there? 
&gt;And Near Peer was brought up to distinguish our near peer threats still fully understand our capabilities 
I know, but I just referred to their capabilities as you seem to imply that fighting the war in Afghanistan with PIDs was somehow unfair (you used the word ""suck""). My point was that, yes, sure PIDs make it harder to win this kind of war, but at the same time there were other factors, such as no enemy air threat that made this ""suck"" less than a war against near-peers. 
&gt;Disagree on the COVID comparison. The lockdowns were a delaying factor. 
I disagree with this. They were not just delaying. They allowed the vaccination strategy to work. Because of them a lot of people who would have otherwise died, didn't die. Exactly the same as with the girls' education. And if the Taliban wins and then forces all the women to homes, then the education of those girls is wasted. Sure, they can now read whatever Taliban allows people to read, but they are not going to be working let alone taking part in politics. 
Regarding infant mortality, to keep that down, you need vaccination programs, infrastructure (for clean water and sewage). Just having people educated won't do much. When your child gets measles because she wasn't vaccinated, it doesn't really help that you can read. 
I mean, of course it's good that they have basic education compared to them having none, but if the political system doesn't let them take advantage of it, there's not that much tangible benefit.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,h44g0g8,41,CMV

He made the paternalistic judgment that if he told people it was important to keep PPE available for healthcare professionals they'd freak out and buy it all up. Maybe he was right, maybe he was wrong, but he didn't tell the truth. 
Early in the pandemic, he compared the IFR of the flu to the CFR of COVID, presenting them as if they were equivalent numbers for different diseases. He knew better, but there wasn't enough data to get a clear IFR at the time. Rather than giving an accurate framing of the data, he conflated the two numbers to give a scarier than accurate view of reality in a paternalistic hope of getting people to do what he judged they ought to be doing. 
On another occasion he stated that less than 10% of COVID infections happen outdoors. The data he had available to him at the time showed the true number was around 0.1%, which *is* less than 10% but he stretched the truth by a factor of a hundred to keep people afraid of going to outdoor gatherings. Again, he made a paternalistic decision about what people needed to hear instead of telling people what he knew to be the truth. 
The best analogy I have is abstinence only sex education: When you tell teens that if they have sex (even protected sex!) they're guaranteed to get multiple STDs and end up with a baby they can't deal with, they know they're not getting the truth, and the ""educators"" spreading this message know they're not telling the truth. They're making a paternalistic judgment that the truth isn't scary enough, and that teens need to be told a scarier version to get them to do the right thing. But since teens know they're not being told the truth, they often overcompensate in the opposite direction, assume the risks to be negligible, and they fail to take proper precautions
Fauci's paternalistic messaging is similar. People quickly realized that Fauci was overstating the risks. But because he opted to hide the best available data from them, they don't have good information to make their decisions on. The result is that they overcompensate too far in the wrong direction, assume everything Fauci says is baseless, and don't take the precautions they reasonably should take. 
And none of this paternalistic messaging is in any way based on science. With abstinence only sex education, study after study showed that kids who received abstinence only sex education were more likely to get pregnant and get STDs than otherwise. If there were some study that said ""This is the messaging that has the best results in getting teens to do what's best for them,"" I'd still have ethical issues with it, but I could see a case for using that messaging instead of the truth, but policy makers and educators don't have those kinds of studies, they have their own intuitions that contradict the data. 
Likewise, Fauci's decisions to tell people things that aren't accurate aren't based on some studies that say ""If people are told X, they will do Y,"" it's based on his paternalistic intuition backed by exactly zero data.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,h8y2fib,44,CMV

Most of what you said here also applies to the Covid vaccine. Covid was not around before I started my program. And I hope you do not believe that since I consented to vaccines previously that I am also automatically consenting now. That seems to go against the pillars of consent where every 'ask' is considered individually. In terms of it being an individual, I do not know why people are so stuck on that. What if there was a policy that if professors have health issues students are expected to help them out (and this was implemented halfway through the course). The back pain is a health issue, the request is not actually that invasive (less than vaccine, though of course the benefit is less too). But if it is the professor asking, or the professor asking with backing from the establishment, that really can't be the defining difference between coercion and consent, can it? 
&amp;#x200B;
&gt;There is certainly a difference between purposely infecting someone, however there is a middle level of guilt as well where someone might not purposely infecting someone but willingly taking action to unnecessarily increase the risk of that happen. Same as DUI, if you are driving drunk and kill someone, you didn't kill them on purpose, but you took action to unnecessarily increase the risk of that happening and as such you are at least partly responsible of the outcome. Of course DUI manslaughter is much easier to trace the action-consequence link than in not taking the vaccine and someone that comes in contact with you gets infected, but the logic stays the same, you not taking the vaccine unnecessarily increases the risk of someone being exposed to the virus because of your decision. 
I not disagree with this. But DUI is illegal, not taking the vaccine is legal. Of course if I get covid and infect others (though this is actually very unlikely) I would feel guilty even though I broke no laws. 
&gt;Do you believe the same for every law? Do you think it's unfair that you weren't asked for consent when you were born under a government that tells you ""pay taxes or suffer setbacks"", ""don't kill people or suffer setbacks"", etc? Or maybe the reason we have governments at all is to impose these kinds of rules onto society because we mostly agree that having an arbiter that puts these kinds of rules (and enforces setbacks when the rules are broken) is a net benefit to society than leaving everyone only follow the rules that each individual consents to follow? 
So I believe there two distinctions. One is that government is provided special powers over private entities (though I still wouldn't say you 'consented to every law' that doesn't seem like consent - does it). But we accept this as being ok because government has special powers that individual entities do not (at least, that is my view). However, like I said, I still do not say this is consensual. People are definitely deterred from killing others because of threats of prison if they do (that does seem like coercion, though I definitely agree that it is good). 
&gt;As far as I'm aware, the federal government takes full responsibility of the liability related to any severe side-effect related to the vaccine
That is false. It is actually quite well known that nobody is actually liable. You can only fill out something on the lines of 'I was harmed unfairly' but no, nobody claims responsibility for any such damage.

Italy was hit extremely hard at the start of the pandemic and spent a lot of time needing to triage medical cases because they didn't have the resources to help everyone. If you cannot get treatment, the death rate for Covid jumps drastically. I can't speak for Belgium, but I can say with some certainty that the UK has, in fact, simultaneously had some of the worst leadership in history - Boris Johnson is the UK Trump in many ways, and many of the actions he took seemed tailor-made to make the pandemic worse.

I don't know what you argument here. Trump was being nationalist here. He is saying that we don't want to be infected by those nasty Mexicans. It's not a pretty idea. Nor one that I agree with, but it's not racist.  I don't understand why people won't call the ugliness what it is, nationalism. 
The caravan thing was ridiculous. There was no reason to consider that a a national emergency. But again it's not racist. These people are crossing our border illegally.

479,"&gt;Public gatherings are illegal (if they're not where you're at then they should be)
Restaurants have been open for months where I live, and deaths are not increasing.","&gt;Coronavirus kills people
Coronavirus kills mostly old people. The vast majority of deaths are 80 and older. These people are already older than average life expectancy. I don't mean to sound cruel or harsh, but the fact is, they will likely die very soon anyway, if not from covid, from literally anything else. 
Lots of things kill people. We could stop 100% of car deaths if we simply banned all cars from the road. That's 45k deaths every single year. And most of those deaths are teenagers, who have barely begun to live. Heart disease and stroke kill 15 million people every year. Those diseases aren't killing 90-year-olds like covid, they are killing 40 and 50-year-olds, who still have some time to be productive members of society and finish raising their children. We could prevent 90% of those deaths in the next generation if we simply forced everyone in the world to stop eating greasy high cholesterol food. 
Diabetes and cancer are also leading killers that can be caused by poor diet and exercise. Simply force the whole world to eat healthy and maybe we could all live to be 100. 
Lung cancer kills 1.7 million every year. We could prevent most of those deaths if we ban cigarettes, cigars, and the like. 
And here's the thing, doing either of the above things doesn't destroy our entire economy, and put millions out of work. Doing those things would save far more lives than corona kills, and yet few talk about it, because we all understand that individual freedom is more important. So why on earth is 600k deaths suddenly the point where everyone panics, and tries to change our entire way of life to try to prevent it, when you could be saving 20x that number if you focused on other things. And not just saving more lives, but saving younger lives. 
And you know what also kills people? Suicide and starvation. You know what causes those things? Losing your job, so you don't have enough money to pay your bills and buy more food. 
&gt;It's a pandemic
Ok... So what? Some strain of flu becomes a pandemic every single year and kills hundreds of thousands of people. Malaria kills just as many. 
&gt;Public gatherings are illegal (if they're not where you're at then they should be)
Restaurants have been open for months where I live, and deaths are not increasing. Precautions are being taken, like erecting plastic barriers between tables, or having more space between tables, having servers wear masks, extra cleaning protocols, etc. 
Similar things could be done in schools. You could require masks. You could erect barriers between desks (making those barriers would provide jobs to many low skill workers who are now out of a job). And you can do things like have only half the class come in on Monday and Tuesday, and the other half come in on Wednesday Thursday, in order to limit the number of people in one room, and allow for space between so people aren't infecting others. You can also make this optional, and allow parents to choose. And rather than having kids go from classroom to classroom, keep them in the same room so they aren't spreading things to different rooms... There's lots of things you can do to limit the spread and still allow them to open, so that kids can get a quality education, and so people can keep their jobs, and continue to pay taxes and provide for their families. 
Because you know what hurts kids even worse than corona? Their parents not being able to afford food, and their government not being able to fund food stamps anymore. 
&gt;Masks are required. 
Ok... Shouldn't that help? 
&gt;The shit is airborn. 
Hence the masks...
&gt;Opening schools will result in loss of life and spread of the virus. 
Keeping schools closed will result in thousands of jobs lost. Teachers might still be able to work remotely, but janitors, bus drivers, mechanics, and a whole host of other people employed by schools cannot work from home. Their jobs are just... gone. They are potentially collecting unemployment, but our government was already in huge debt before this started. We can't keep this many people on unemployment forever. Sooner or later, these people need to do something productive for society. And many of them want to... But can't, because you won't let them. 
Further, keeping schools closed will result in children not getting a proper education. My wife has been dealing with professors through this, and she was a straight A student until now. Lots of professors have no idea how to use technology to set up a good online course. They simply tell students to read some pages over email, and send them tests. There is no learning going on there. Lots of people don't learn well by reading. They need someone to help explain the material in different ways. Or they learn by doing and experiencing, debating, or by listening... And none of that can happen through online courses. Or if it can, it is of much lesser quality. Meanwhile, colleges are still requiring students to pay full tuition, despite getting a much lesser experience. 
Young children who struggle to learn this way will quickly fall behind, and may fail a grade or two. Teens who struggle to learn this way might struggle to graduate high school, or have poor grades and not be able to get into college they otherwise could have easily qualified for, missing out on job opportunities. 
Is it worth destroying our economy, and destroying our future, all to save the lives of a few 80-year-olds who will be dead soon anyway? I don't think it is. And besides, we can VERY EASILY isolate old people. They are retired anyway. They don't have to work, they can live off their retirement or social security. But the young don't have that option. And if too many young are put out of work, social security will run out of money too, and then the elderly will die anyway when they can't afford food and medicine.",1,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,fyt4rep,37,CMV

You literally called me to fix something, and now you're telling me I'm wrong... like wtf...
&gt;Here's the part I believe but want to discuss: vaccinations are effective in massively reducing the danger that covid poses. Breakthrough hospitalization and death rates are considerably less than the rates that we would see for the flu. While we accepted that the flu should be fought wherever possible, we accepted that the flu presented a certain risk but not enough for us to change our lives. 
&gt;Covid numbers are high mostly among the unvaccinated and the extreme majority of hospitalizations and deaths are from the unvaccinated. With the vaccine being freely and widely available, those that are not vaccinated are for the most part people who have chosen not to protect themselves. They have the right to make that choice and to take that risk, but I unvaccinated deaths and hospitizations are not ones I take into consideration when thinking about covid safety. 
&gt;Of course there are edge cases, like children and people who can't get the vaccine but the responsibility to protect themselves should fall to them rather than having the general population act to protect them. 
We have a moral responsibility to save as many lives as possible, whether we like it or not. And there are a lot of people not vaccinated. Hospitals are filling, making it difficult to treat everyone (even those without covid). Saw a reddit post today about someone waiting 12 hrs for an ER room for a non covid related event to get treatment... 
We should be doing whatever we can to keep hospitals empty. This allows non covid patients to still receive treatment... 
Also, how does a hospital know that a COVID-19 patient is vaccinated? When administering care, how do you have the time to probe this when it is a life threatening situation? Once a hospital starts treatment, they can't just stop. So checking covid vaccination records would be required before treatment, which delays necessary care for everyone (including the vaccinated)...
&gt;The flu kills people every year and yet we did not shut down events. Car accidents kill people every year and yet we do not stop driving cars. I know it is callous to say but a certain number of deaths are inevitable and since the only valid numbers in my mind are the deaths among the vaccinated, covid no longer crosses the threshold of deaths that would make me think that we should change our behaviors. 
&gt;I really do grapple with this so I would love to have people challenge this idea but I stuggle with wanting to protect people who will not protect themselves. 
Are hospitals filled to capacity by these things? Almost never... Covid takes beds from those who need them... We gotta minimize this. Wearing a mask is easy.

Try severe lung damage like my cousin. Dunno, getting told by your doctor that you have lung damage equivalent to a 2-pack a day smoker, but unlike the smoker, no hope of recovery, is really no what I call ""non-recoverable"". Renal failure also should be kept in mind, as he also lost a kidney in the ordeal, though they aren't sure if it was the COVID, or something else that just jumped at the opportunity. 
&gt; For the last time. IT ISNT ABOUT THE VACCINE ITS ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT TELLING YOU WHERE YOU CAN AND CANT GO BECAYSE OF A NEEDLE. 
Yes, I know that. To borrow a turn of phrase... For the last time: Some people don't give a rat's ass, and would rather know for a fact they won't end up on a respirator with permanent lung damage and losing the sense of smell and/or taste, two things you could be really surprised how life-altering it is, because some unvaccinated moron decided to bring in a variant that isn't all that affected by the vaccine. But as I'm sure neither of us is an immunologist, I'll stick to my guns and say that if immunology experts say those are needed measure, I'll vote for the guys with 10+ years of college and university and practice, over a guy on the internet who doesn't like the word ""governement"". 
&gt; Why vaccinate someone if they have the antibodies. 
Why vaccinate for the flu yearly? Same reason: Variants. Some stuff like the MMR address viruses with a low mutation rate. The flu amd COVID-19 are much higher on the mutation rate, and keeping on top of the game is important. Also, they don't even know 100% sure how long will the antibodies remain in your system, but they know that after roughly 8 months, they are back to low enough that the worst symptoms are likely again, which is why they are talling of booster shots for COVID. 
&gt; What about public parks? Or malls? Yet you don't need to prpve you're vaccinated to get in. 
In a restaurant, you need to take off your mask to eat. In a bar, same thing to drink. And in a gym, it's likely you'll want it off because while it doesn't get in the way of breathing, it can actually cause issues with panting, as like I tried a couple times before while going out for a jog and realized it was a bad idea, panting happens when your body needs more air than usual, and masks do happen to have a limit of how much air you can breathe through them comfortably... It just so happens to be higher than regular breathing. 
What do malls and parks have in common? That's right! People usually wear masks in them, and some people are actually thrown out when they don't. Maybe not where you live, but my city has ordinances to that effect for both locations. 
It's not always just ""they want to control you"". Maybe in the USA, or some South American countries it is a question of control. Russia, too, maybe. Some African countries, and maybe some Middle-Eastern ones. And I can't deny, for sure, that if you live in constant fear of your government turning tyrannical, you shouldn't be skeptical... 
But at the same time, you always have to wonder:What would the government gain in controlling you outside of a restaurant or a gym for not being vaccinated? Not much. You can eat at home, you can go to the groceries to get food, you can get take out or delivery if you want restaurant food. And you also can exercise at home, in several ways. They gain nothing, lose taxes on those products, could lead to jobs being lost from restaurants and gyms being closed for lack of attendence. If they are democratic, and have regular elections, they could easily lose their job to a disgruntled population if they really over-reach.

20% of what number? Let's take a look:
https://www.koin.com/news/health/coronavirus/josephine-county-has-worst-covid-death-rate-in-oregon/
&gt;In the tri-county area, 77% of all adults are now vaccinated. Since July 13, the death counts are less than 3.5 per 100,000 people. Combined in the metro counties, the rate is 2.2 people died of COVID for every 100,000 people. 
&gt;But in the most populous counties in southwestern Oregon — where vaccine rates are far lower — the story is much more grim. Only 57% of adults have been vaccinated in those counties and the death rate since July 13 is far greater in these counties. 
If the state is highly vaccinated and the vaccine didn't work then we would expect that the number of deaths of the vaccinated would be commensurate with the number of deaths of the unvaccinated. But they clearly aren't if 80% of the deaths represent &lt;40% of the population. And those who are most at risk are the most likely to be vaccinated, so that paints an even starker picture.

this is my biggest point. If the virus came from china and we knew about it from time. Why didn't we lock down as soon as possible? 
Are we talking about the US in particular? Or the world in general? Because in the case of the latter the answer is that some places did, some places didn't. A full lockdown is hard, and while places like Taiwan were immensely successful, a lot of other countries had neither the infrastructure nor the public will to shut down when things didn't seem bad. 
If you mean the US in particular, it is because your president was a fucking idiot. Also because the 50 state structure makes it difficult for the US to adequately organize a response. 
&gt;not only that but the case of allowing the Entity in which the virus originated from be held without consequence. I understand that China is a super power but the idea that they won't point the finger at China at all is concerning and they mock trump who's used as a scape goat character to discredit this idea. 
  

  

It's Bio terrorism even if unintentional. millions have died yet no responsibility. why is no one being held accountable people like pointing the finger. where is it being pointed to? The people themselves? FOOLISH people get your vaccine it's you guys not following our guidelines and restrictions
Part of the issue with this is that it isn't helpful. China didn't intentionally let the disease through their borders, anymore than my country of Canada can blame the US for royally fucking us over by all the americans who sauntered up here without even basic protections against disease. 
There is no evidence that they intended to do this (it has hurt them immensely from a financial point of view for basically no real gain on their end), so at best you can say they didn't manage to lock it down in time. But neither did the US. Or the UK. We have hundreds of 'Delta Variant' cases in Canada, should I be saying that we should punish the UK for not containing the spread of the variant? 
&gt;now you will identify the people who refuse this ""non mandatory vaccine"" and you will restrict them because what? they are a threat to public health? The virus was said to only harm those at risk such as elderly and people with medical conditions . let them have the vaccine first . how about you do more testing before you try to expand it to the whole population who will not experience long term effects from this Virus . and don't try to push this booster shot idea for something that people can get over in 2 weeks . 
Correct, yes. If you choose not to get a publicly available vaccine without reason, then you are knowingly risking the health of others for no adequate reason. Even if it only harmed people at risk (it doesn't, it could straight up kill you, it is just less likely), you carrying it puts other people at risk, which is why we want you to get the vaccine. 
Herd immunity is a fairly basic concept. If you can't get it, you can't pass it. If the overwhelming majority of people can't get it, then it stops spreading entirely. Then grandma is less likely to die. Or my immunocompromised niece who has spent the last year and a half living in fear that some asshole is going to cough on her and end her life, someone who can't get the vaccine because of her condition. 
As for testing, the various covid vaccines are actually tested in the same sort of way we would test most new vaccines. The only difference is that normally we would test vaccines in various stages. Stage one goes well, okay now do stage two, now three. Instead many of these tests were done in parallel, allowing what is normally done over the course of multiple years to be done in one.

It was as if those women I was talking to were saying ""You really actually want to be like us, and the endgame is when everyone thinks like we do.""

I don't know if his thesis about the ""causal arrow"" is 100% true, bit I do think it is at least somewhat true, and that reading this will give you some insight into what I have seen far too much of online: Men looking for compassion, driven to despair and bitterness and resentment, and more radical thinking, by the responses they get from the social justice movement online.

I was most certainly bullied as a kid, and I could talk for a long time about the ways it affected me, but suffice to say it made me think of social situations as a battlefield where I had to ward off blows, and stunted my ability to be open and trusting with people. As I've gotten older, I've gained the courage to be far more open, but I think I can honestly say there is still a person inside who is quite affected when that openness is hit hard by cruel comments, as it has been. 
...but, again, those comments have almost entirely come from those who preached social justice and compassion and acceptance for diversity in people. And in connection to the larger issues we're talking about, you can be a straight while male in our society and observe massive outpourings of compassion for certain popular reasons, but get told you are the enemy if you seek compassion for how you feel, or that your problems are not 'real problems'. 
I will share with you that I lost a brother a few years ago, and then another one last year. COVID has also been rough financially, and there's a bunch of other stuff going on.

Police warn a dozen times that if people do not move they will be maced and that they will start using rubber bullets.  People hold up their hands or get on their knees and say ""don't shoot"" before getting maced/shot by rubber bullets and then put that up on youtube without the warnings.  We have the right to peacefully protest, we do not have the right to block critical highways, there is a difference.  Similarly curfews are in effect due tot he rioting and looting.

When someone gets paintballed on their porch we can argue about whether or not they should get paintballed.  My question though is ""why don't you just go inside?  People have burned down the city for 4 nights straight.  Work with them a little here, it's not like you're being horribly oppressed...they are trying to stop people from burning down the city.""  If you want to protest them telling you to go inside then walk out with your hands up and say ""I refuse to go inside because I do not believe this is ok, i accept being paintballed and arrested but I will stand up for my beliefs"".  THAT I can get behind.  Staying outside because your dumb ass is too stupid to understand the situation and stop recording I cannot.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

When a man yells insults, homophobic slurs, and calls a black officer an uncle tom for something other officers did in a state thousands of miles away for multiple minutes.....then gets angry when he gets pepper sprayed in his second story window, I laugh.  Should the officer have pepper sprayed him?  Prolly not.  But to try and pretend what it's ok for someone to just unleashed minutes worth of hate speech on someone is downright stupid.  An innocent person didn't get sprayed there, a homophobic asshole got sprayed.  Maybe he shouldn't have been, but play stupid games win stupid prizes.

All it does is serve to discredit the real problems happening.

Communism and socialism are broad topics without a general consensus by their respective proponents. While I am not familiar with the work of Von Mises, I can say that generally one person cannot disprove something so broad. Was his work theoretical? AFAIK, there hasn't really been a *truly* socialist society; they've all been dictatorships which is antithetical. I don't really think about whether socialism could or couldn't work; however, I wouldn't rule it out until a properly controlled test demonstrated its failure, and not just looking at the failures of totalitarian governments like China, Nazi Germany, USSR, DPRK, etc. If a quality controlled study was conducted and determined socialism would always fail, then I would have no problem deeming it a flawed ideology. 
&gt;Liberals are anti science on race and gender as well. 
This is dubious. I'll assume you're talking about things that fall under the category of pseudoscience via scientific racism/sexism (e.g. *clearly unbiased* data conducted by white men not at all conveniently showing that white men just happen to be the most fit demographic to take on the important roles in society like leadership /s). Being anti-pseudoscience is not equal to being anti-science. This is exactly what I'm talking about, though. People will try to equate a dismissal of  ~~bullshit~~ alt-facts with a dismissal of an ideology, and *that* is why communication fails. Conservatives make it impossible to find common ground when they deny real facts, ignore empirically sound, peer reviewed research, then expect the left to show reverence to the erroneous or totally made up ""truths"" that they share.

499,"Multiple post-approval longitudinal studies were needed to convince the FDA that the heart attack risks were real, and it is still approved in other countries, amazingly.","&gt;This post feels well intentioned so I want to be nice. 
If I’m honest, the fact that people even feel the need to talk like this is a sign that science has taken a back seat to social engineering.  Genuine questions about the choices made for regulatory enforcement and scientific methods lead to derision and “wanting to be nice.”  What a sad state of affairs. 
&gt; Getting COVID is undeniably worse for most of the population than any adverse effects from the vaccine. We have widespread real world data on how effective these vaccines are and that, in my opinion, supersedes any data from clinical trials. 
But there’s the unavoidable factor of time.  We can’t know long-term effects because we haven’t studied anyone long term yet.  And one thing no one has actually told me about that I suppose I should have asked is this: if there were to be long term effects, what might they be?  Since mRNA vaccines on humans are relatively new, how would we know what to anticipate and look for in follow up for the trials? 
&gt; Additionally many other regulatory bodies across the developed world have authorized these vaccines not just the FDA. That should give you some degree of confidence as well that extremely distinguished scientific bodies globally believe these vaccines are safe and effective for their populations. 
As a global public health community, we lack standards harmonization, so this actually backfires. Everyone is using different methods and standards to evaluate the drugs and treatments, which means that you can’t really compare.  Its one thing that absolutely needs to change.  And I’m torn here because on the one hand, multiple different methods arriving at the same conclusion can be considered an indicator of the strength of that conclusion.  But alternatively, the fact that no one uses the same methods makes cross-comparison impossible, too.  
&gt; Finally you raise the point about not knowing the long term effects of the vaccine. While this might be technically true, we have begun studying the short, medium and long term effects for COVID survivors and we know many of those effects to be very bad including lung scarring, brain damage and a laundry list of others. 
Things like Vioxx make me wary of this line of thought.  Multiple post-approval longitudinal studies were needed to convince the FDA that the heart attack risks were real, and it is still approved in other countries, amazingly. 
&gt; You seem like a rational person who wants to be safe. As a fellow rational person I think you should make the best decision with the information we do have available. Please get vaccinated friend. If you are hung up on the EUA please more that Pfizer will almost certainly get fully authorized in the coming months and you could consider that a very safe and effective option. Good luck to you
I appreciate it, I am thinking about Moderna because I trust NIAID as an infectious disease agency, and they worked with Moderna to create that vaccine.  I just know that for any other pharmaceutical product, the notion of widespread rollout prior to FDA Approval or the finishing of at least 2 RCT Phase 3 trials would elicit calls of corruption and allegations of unsafe conduct.  One other commenter asserted that no vaccine completes Phase 3 trials before going to market.  If that person, or anyone else for that matter, can show this to be true, it would mean waiting on long term, finished phase 3 trials is irrelevant in the vaccine sphere of medical research, which would mean I’m worrying about nothing.  But to be honest, knowing how complex regulating biologics is, and how little experience the FDA has in that sphere, I’m concerned about the proper procedures being followed.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,h35j54a,32,CMV

created by science zombieman is questioning gods existence a cosmic entity of unknown type and concept, with eldritch physiology this enigma appearing in chapter 132 is only referred to as god by homeless emperor and psykos. it can bestow power of an unknown limit, is capable of astral projection, dimension manipulation and free interaction with anyone he chooses to interact with. it gave homeless emperor, who is a parody of jesus christ, the ability to use energy and may have created vaccine man being referred to as its alias of nature.  if it is the origin of unnatural monsterization is unclear as his goal and abilities are wildly unknown, yet it has an immense hated on humans just as much as his minions.  it is to be noted that this entity is not true omnipotent as it has a personality and relies on other beings to fulfill his wishes. contradicting to allah/jehovah/yahweh.  ""your power, your life...i am taking them all."" after breaking the contract, god takes hes soul and the bestowed ability the being can as well take the soul of anyone that failed on the mission received by god, the bestowed must be alive for this to happen, it is not confirmed if they would receive the soul after natural death as well or not. it is implied they have a variety of supernatural abilities that they can freely give to any being of their choosing, the complexity and size of this arsenal is still a mystery. monsterization is completely unpredictable, in addition to their origin and emergence.  child emperor speculating about monsters  i noticed that monsters of instant change only range in power from the threat levels of wolve to dragon. not a single mysterious being has appeared of a level of god in general! indications are that saitama who has fought thousands mentions boros (a natural mysterious being) as his strongest foe and vaccine man has been established as the greatest danger the ha has faced. meanwhile the range in power level is astronomical! humans like psykos, genus, fukegao and bofoi have found out how to create monsters. these belong into the scientifically creations and are simply referred to as mutants. unlike most others these lack the ability of bloodlust, a concept that most unnaturals have to follow is to kill something, whether its a human, animal or even another monster just for the heck of it. the stronger a monster gets, the more out of control it will become carnage kabuto was a failed product, unlike armored gorilla, zombieman, slugerous etc. he could not feel sympathy at all and was a danger to himself and others. carnage kabuto cannot be cloned easily, hes rather hard to create murata on the question if genus could produce more of kabuto the results depend on the raw material. gouketsu talking about the function of monster cells a living drug finally, after years i created the ultimate drug: bizeps king! if you drink this brother, you will become the strongest in the world! fukegao before turning his brother into a mutant subject number 66. the only success in the immortality experiment dr. genus took many tries to create zombieman scientifically creations will fail most of the times, much like products for daily life like shampoo tested on animals beforehand, the outcome is not a first try success! spontaneous mutation of cells in ones body in form of an unnatural change will result in all kinds of different looks and abilities. unlike science this concept ignores if a subject was strong or had healthy genes to begin with. nyan is classified as dragon level while originating in his former life of a cat. even amongst the classes are sub-forms of monsters such that fuse with their character will inherit its fictional powers. pesky, phoenixman and electric catfish are the only examples of costume-monsters, and they all share their characters abilities.  you should know, becoming a monster saved my life. i became free. phoenixman thinking of his transformation as a gift for a new life despair is a word that grinds itself through the story of one punch man, despite living in a futuristic world people are not happy, even without the appearance of disasters society has started crumbling on its own, ending up in many lives destroyed, families taken apart and jobs being lost, dreams destroyed. civilization is constantly under stress and this is another symptom. if a human is suicidal but wishes to change its life before taking its own life it will do so instantly. the change of becoming a monster will not result in becoming a being of absolute evil, nearly all monsters can choose what to do for themselves and feelings like sadness, happiness, anger, disgust and even love will remain in them, much as their memories of their former selves and even the personality will not have much of an impact, yet all former living beings need to abolish their humanity alias being a human. progressive change: a small number of specific individuals with the ambition of change, but the restrain of giving up their humanity may end up on becoming a mysterious being after a long-term event. characters undergo several steps and transform repeatedly until they have set an absolute limit to their spirits and bodies capabilities. humans as well as already-monsters can undergo this evolution if they are not restrained by natural forces and abilities of their own.  like a zenkai a character must undergo a near death experience, in doing so they will immediately break their former limit and transcend to a much higher one. with his ability of resurrection empowerment, phoenixman brings this concept to the next level and can enter the realm of threat level god.  unlike basic training and even a training on advanced level, stagnating ones strength to their original limit is time and energy-consuming but may end up in great power this type of change does it instantly. and thisisto goeven further beyond!!! goku (dragonball z) breaking his limit to archive ssj3 each change boosts power in all conditional aspects and stays permanent, the main downgrade to training is that this process may take damage on the spirit and soul of the user. loss of feelings and identity are the results. mysterious beings that have archived this state seem to be uninterested in mindless destruction but rather have only one thing in mind: being challenged to feel once more alive. god has set a limiter on all that is alive! dr. genus, an evolutionist, believes in god all beings that exist have a limit to what they can archive, and all these limits are different. unlike in the real-world people in one punch man are naturally capable of archiving superhuman strength, speed, and durability. even a worm can become a danger to a group of humans. the limiters are differentiated by a natural force, dr. genus refers to it as god being the one to set all these limitations to cause order in the universe. so, breaking and archiving a new limiter may be against what nature wants after all!? then one day, a great seer told me somewhere on a faraway planet, a being exists who is my match; one who could rekindle my passion for battle. my men thought the prophecy was a ruse, a fairy tale meant to focus my attention and lure me away. a seer representing cthulhu tells boros about a possible future with the design of an eldritch god the alien-seer is the only character seen so far having a similarity to god. can it be that boros was causing too much destruction and bringing the order of the cosmos out of control, endangering many aspects of nature? being a limit-breaker himself, getting rid of boros is something nature aims for.  yet how to get rid of him? how about setting him up against another nuisance in form of another limit-breaker that can be found on a specific planet. is blast a limit-breaker? it is highly speculated so as saitama was too young and boros could have appeared soon before the latter become older, garou was not even born at that point, but one thing is for sure: two heads are better than one! what? who are you? homeless emperor questioning gods changed appearance with his shapeshifting abilities god can seemingly take in the form of everything he desires.  progressive change ends in a multi-mutation and is a metamorphosis of which it is near impossible to break out, only by reclaiming ones humanity it is possible to change back to the original state, the concept of pure willpower is one that can overpower even this state of monsterization. after an individually number of broken limitations a character will reach a level that cannot be increased with this method anymore, only with the interference of a higher entity or a temporary transformation someone can further become stronger. there exist measurements to prevent both the complete transformation as well as the side aspects of a monsters corrupted state of mind, but before speaking of them the most notorious and yet controversial method of increasing prowess need to be explained. since this method is wildly missing fact-based information from manga, webcomic and author i can build off, i will theorize most from my head and combine everything into a description that seems most logical for the current state of the series. this method is real and is accomplished by only one character in the series so far! i became too strong, eventually, i found there were none left that could face me. i came to know the torment of utter, all-encompassing boredom. born as a prodigy of a powerful race and battling countless beings, boros broke his limiter and was unchallenged ""you lie. you had strength to spare. i never stood a chance. it wasn't even a battle. so much for prophecies. you were too strong...  until he met saitama who had removed his completely. failed monsterization/ limiter-removal: if a being wants to change into something else while absolutely insisting on their true self and bringing themselves into an extreme state of critical condition beyond any reasoning their absolute limit will be removed forever.  saitama is the only character who has accomplished this state and reached what is called zenith. the highest form of superpower evolution, the power to ascend to the maximum stage of power zenith not just meant for a joke or to explain unreasonable strength, reaching absolute power is a concept that exists in the world of one punch man but only has one successor.  100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, and a 10km run every single day!!! saitamas most famous quote  saitama while being somewhat fit, yet average took his dream and made it true: becoming a hero who can defeat everyone in a punch. though instead of becoming a new being in form of a monster he stayed the same in all that he is.  im not a hero because i want your approval. i do it because i want to! - being a hero for fun saitama does whatever he wants, he is free, and he did it without needing to become a monster. living in absolute solitude and barely interacting with humans, saitama never got the feelings for anyone or could contribute the deadly sins as there was no-one else in his life besides himself and himself, he never hated.  as a monster you can do whatever you want! gouketsu monsters believe despite their superiority they can please as they do and are free so did crablante, phoenixman, bakuzan and many others to ultimately receive the consequences. you cant just go around attacking other planets because your bored! saitama being displeased by boros behavior  saitama has a specific concept of justice, evil and good dont simply exist for him just because someone looks different or acts different, its what the meaning behind these actions are that saitama is interested in.  you never wanted to become a monster, what you really wanted to be was a hero! saitama becoming garous hero - instantly breaking him outside the process of monsterization, thus garou becoming the first character to fully regain his human self since the monsterization that started of as a progressive change failed only specific side effects remain on saitama, most notably the decreasing feelings for himself and excitement in former things such as fights that came to enjoy. spending time with others can seemingly stop this symptom.  in exchange for power, maybe ive lost something thats essential for a human being? spiritual side effects saitama seeks something, which is pretty much the same boros did: a challenging fight that regains the feeling of being alive.  after 1 year i noticed the loss of hair physical side effects losing his hair is the physical aspect of the failed monsterization. just where is this power influencing from!? tatsumaki questioning god while the latter observes everything via omni-vision god has demonstrated to freely interact with everyone of his desire, might it be physically, via astral projection or even in the mind of the person he wants to contract. being able to look inside the deeps of the monster association base as well as to watch all and everything makes him nigh omniscient. saitama is by far no stranger to this corrupted deity.  its like there resists a god inside of him! ha council it is implied that there is a connection between the main protagonist saitama and the potential true main antagonist god. on a special cover of chapter 110 drawn by murata saitama is standing on god! concluding that the god of opm is indeed not paralleled with omnipotence nor the real life religious supreme deity, this being might very much be ruler and setter of all concepts appearing in the story! including: monsterization, limiters and all aspects of physics, reality, and life as it is! god may try everything in order for saitama to be destroyed! saitama questioning his power and further meaning of life, linking both perfectly. saitama has broken the rules of the universe, apposing nature and no one besides god himself is able to stop him now as saitamas limitlessness goes above the maximum of a limiter god can set on a being. thank you! garou thanking the heavens (god) for a massive boost of power to defeat saitama even after powering up awakened garou (representation of lucifer the fallen angel) who broke his former limitations, gods warriors fail against saitama no matter how powerful they have become.  there is yet one aspect of god that should be mentioned: in both chapter 133 as well as the cover 110 the entity has been surrounded by an extraordinary aura that has the appearance of light emerging from within its core. there has been an uprise in monsters lately and its not just they are getting larger in numbers but stronger too! bang discussing the rising monster appearances with atomic samurai it seems like that a specific event triggers that god himself can influence more and more, even outside of the symptoms! while in saitamas childhood a monster of low level appeared every few months in the cities, thousands if not millions of unnatural creations live in the world now, waiting to take their turn. there is a brand of mysterious beings i desperately need to discuss, and no one seems to really question, monsters that go against the norm of all others and what we know of monster biology in general, these are: the unknowns. if you can remember at the start of the topic, i mentioned that none of the descriptions/theories of in-verse characters are fully correct, all of it has some flaws, but especially the description given by dr. genus is broken with the mere existence of these subjects. dr. genus bases all of monster-kind on the aspect that monsters either must be natural or unnatural (scientifically). yet an extremely rare kind is not just unnatural, it was never natural to begin with! those that are illogical in their own existence monsters that became monsters from inanimate, inorganic objects. most notable: a hotdog (hotdog), a jackhammer (building booper), a sniperrifle (rifle), a hydrant (unknown), a shower (showerhead) and more. this confirms already that its not specificized on living beings to monsterize but essentially everything.  this party never stops. time is dead and meaning has no meaning. existence is upside-down and i reign supreme. welcome, one and all, to werdmageddon! with his powers of weirdness inducement bill (gravity falls) can alter the concepts of spacetime, reality and existence final-conclusion: god might have the ability of an aura that infuses upon reality turning those of despair, wishes, sins, obsessions and desires into monsters whether this is instantaneous or progressive. in forms of living beings with a free will those need to either fulfill a contract directly with god (power bestowal) or independently by giving up their humanity (monsterization). the ability can animate, mutate, or induce weirdness into non-living objects constrained from the other rules. at this rate, humanity wont hold much longer! having already turned into a monster himself, sweet mask worries about the future of humankind  since god is expanding upon the variety and forms, he can attack with his ability and increases his power either over time or because a trigger that is yet unknown, more and more monsters will appear and those that stop them might die or fail by doing so sooner or later. even the strongest of heroes cannot do much but prevent damage to cities and infrastructure and try at all costs to save numerous people. god will just send more till everyone is overpowered with his heir of destruction. so long as god has not been detected aka found out by anyone, he will remain untouched. that is why under every matter he keeps the bestowed to shut up before revealing to much about his existence.  even someone like saitama is left helplessness as he cannot be everywhere to help anyone from death all the time and if god insists, he can very well just outlive our protagonist.  finding and defeating the source of unnatural monetarization is a priority!  some humans and mysterious beings of all classes and levels have accomplished or found out a way for themselves to undergo a form of self-control, this may be with an item or change of form. others who are considered mysterious beings but with enough willpower and training are completely able to restrain the urges and weaknesses of a monster such as extreme hatred for others, bloodlust, or the seeking for destruction.  this set of armor, used to seal in my immeasurable irresistible powerhas been broken boros wears an armor to contain the inner energy that goes even above his natural limitations those beings that are either a danger to themselves or do not want to cause harm to others use sets like belts, urns, helmets armor or other things alike to not explode out of their current capabilities. with gearsper we have humans that are bound to restrictive elements as well. monsters like cruel dragon can be sealed away in a containment or dimension that they cannot flee without other interventions.  you were going on a rampage, we had to control you carnage kabuto uses a semi-form to not lose his mind to keep their spirit at an emotionally stable level the extremely vicious beings with the ambition to stay neutral can transform into a lower state, this may cause them to decease in power as well. im not going to fight any heroes! manako has humanity despite being a monster and is uninterested in fighting heroes or causing destruction despite a lower-level monsters viciously attack heroes that can easily kill them, this ends in most cases in their own deaths, such beings may be unredeemable. despite being normally different to other lifeforms most mysterious beings have all emotions and feelings a human has, evenlove! love may be able to break the mutation, it will not end in the re-transformation to their former selves but can give them their humanity back. some of the s-class heroes are likely to be unnatural creations caused by gods influence, but with enough willpower or love for others they will work against his own will. so, to speak gods creations may become its own enemies. once you go monster, you can never go back. nyan believes once a being becomes a monster, they are unable to go back to their original state you were a human after all only to have his statement shattered by garou accomplishing it few hours later conclusion: gods influence is not absolute nor is the ambition the creations do in his deeds. all forms of life are after all: living beings. those that feel, love, bound and believe in their true self become free from any chains. finding an effective way to permanently redeem monsters may break his powers for good. everyone makes mistakes in life, but that doesnt mean they have to pay for them the rest of their life. sometimes good people make bad choices. it doesnt mean they are bad. it means they are human.",1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,122,56,CovidVaccine

manufacturers are going to throw in the towel and just eliminate the toxic adjuvants? theyll eliminate the injected germs which are the very basis of the exercise? theyll make vaccines in outer space, where, hopefully, contamination with random viruses would be avoided? the synthetic genes they insert in the body will magically refrain from creating many horrendous ripple-effects? deeper still, why do immune systems need a rehearsal for the real thingwhich is the foundational hypothesis underlying vaccination. nature isnt sufficient? we must fight off every conceivable germ with a shot in the arm? why not try to improve the strength of immune systems through non-medical means? nutrition, for instance, was the key reason for the historical decline of traditional diseases. along with improved sanitation. no, lets not go there. too many people will reject us if we reject vaccines. i beg to differ. we are in a long-term war against the medical cartel. its not going away. think ten thousand years into the future. thats a reasonable estimate of the length of the battle. look, i know there are serious questions about the original discovery of the covid virus. maybe the researchers didnt use the proper procedures. but lets not awaken that sleeping giant. too many people wont be able to fathom what were talking about. its too far out. then theyll reject everything else were saying. yes? and? so? sooner or later were going to have to bring up the subject. because this isnt the only time discovery was faked. and it wont be the last. so lets jump in now. dont stint. dont hold back. go to the root. i think of my good friend and colleague, robert scott bell. go to his site, robertscottbell.com. listen to his radio show. hes been on the front lines of health for more than 20 years. every day. he dives deep. he never lets people forget that the terrain vs. the germ is still one of the most important debates in human history. are germs the basic problem, or is the overall condition of the body and its ability to remain vibrant and resilient the paramount factor? that argument has been largely forgotten, even in the natural health community. why? because over time, too many people have said, oh, we cant bring that up. its too radical for the masses. so now those natural people are wearing masks and fear the virus. thus proving you can accept every natural slogan coming down the pipeline and still buy counterfeit science. the issue isnt the content of slogans. its the acceptance of any gross shortcuts that seek to avoid the need to do something called thinking. oh. but we must have slogans. people are too dim to figure out matters on their own. good luck with that notion. do you really believe you can win a long-term war, at the root, by engaging in a contest of slogans? thats like saying the failure to teach basic literacy in schools stems from older computers. we need better computers in classrooms. idiots delight, brought to you by bill gates. a ten-thousand-year war. dont shrink away from it. heres an historical example of root vs. compromise. its called pellagra. among the symptoms: large scaly sores. huge areas of red inflamed skin. diarrhea. weakness. loss of appetite. abdominal pain. in the early 20th century, several million people in the american south suffered from it. public health officials asserted the cause was a germ. the question was, which germ? a prestigious government commission was appointed to find the answer. at the time, there were people who suspected a germ wasnt the cause, but they kept their mouths shut, in part because they thought they couldnt sell the idea. it was too radical. better to argue about whether quarantines would work. better to argue about whether case clusters were a fertile area for research. better to argue about whether the germ might be carried in corn, across farms. better to argue about unique weather conditions in the south, where the disease was concentrated. argue about anything other than the existence of a germ as the causative agent. flash forward thirty years. after fighting their own war, a few researchers correctly convinced the medical world that pellagra was the result of a niacin deficiency. there was no germ. it didnt exist. it was a pompous assumption, championed by arrogant scientists, who wanted to own the territory of disease research. what if the few dissenting investigators, who endured three decades of utter rejection by the establishment, had decided, well, we cant claim theres no germ involved at all. that would be too much. we cant go that far. we cant go to the root. lets debate about the weather, the case clusters, the corn fieldsissues where we can make a stand, where we can have an effect",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,48471,44,CovidVaccine

a full and complete health care plan, which of course he has promised many times before. hes pretty excited about it, sen.","campaigns and white houses always seek message discipline, the state of having everyone repeat the same carefully chosen phrases and arguments over and over in an endlessly numbing drone in order to pound their ideas through the skulls of the electorate. its something the trump campaign and the trump administration have never achieved, for a few reasons. first, as a group the people who work for president trump are not particularly smart or skilled at politics. second, because they work for trump they are often called upon to defend the indefensible, whether its disastrous negligence, shocking corruption, or farcical lies. and third, trump is so erratic and self-contradictory that it can be almost impossible for them to keep track of which brand of lickspittlery theyre supposed to perform at any given moment. so watching the trump spin machine whining, clunking, and throwing off sparks isnt a bad way to ascertain just how deeply this president is failing, in both practical and political terms. lets take a tour of what weve heard from them in the last couple of days. on cnn, dana bash tried to get dr. deborah birx, a top adviser on the pandemic, to explain why the united states has failed so utterly to contain the virus when many other countries have succeeded. though birx has plainly worked hard to avoid trumps wrath, even she could not bring herself to claim that the administrations performance has been stellar, as he so often claims. so her boss went after her: its unclear what he meant when he said birx hit us."" but he may have been referring to this claim: what we are seeing today is different from march and april. it is extraordinarily widespread. its into the rural as equal urban areas. thats the sort of simple statement of fact that trump cannot tolerate. or trump may have been referring to birxs claim about schools reopening: if you have high caseload and active community spread, just like we are asking people ... not to create large spreading events, we are asking people to distance learn at this moment, so we can get this epidemic under control. which directly contradicts trumps repeated insistence that schools must reopen because everything is fine, as he tweeted monday morning: should birx persist in reluctantly admitting the obvious, she might find herself cast out. on abcs this week, treasury secretary steven mnuchin was more firmly planted in the presidents fantasy world, repeating three times that we have to get kids back into school and proclaiming that everything is going to be fine. we couldnt be more pleased with the scientific improvements that were making on testing, that were making on the vaccine, mnuchin said. and i think when we have a vaccine and life gets back to normal, youre going to see a great economy again next year. on cbss face the nation, chief of staff mark meadows insisted: we continue to test more than any country in the world."" it only looks bad because we do so much testing, never mind that we have 4 percent of the worlds population and nearly one-quarter of the worlds covid deaths. asked to justify the presidents insane suggestion that the election should be delayed, meadows said, well, it was a question mark no harm, no foul. and he echoed trumps attacks on mail voting, an assault that has republican officials terrified that hes undermining their own mail balloting efforts (which have been highly successful in past elections). over on fox news sunday, trump campaign adviser jason miller said were going through this coronavirus recovery right now, which may have been the single most bizarre statement of the weekend. but then miller refused to categorically rule out taking foreign assistance in the election. then he finally said, there is no foreign assistance thats happening in this campaign, a comment strikingly reminiscent of bill clintons precise use of the present tense about monica lewinsky: there is not a sexual relationship."" and the president himself is once again claiming hell release what he called a full and complete health care plan, which of course he has promised many times before. hes pretty excited about it, sen. lindsey graham said of the imaginary plan, which may be true, in the same sense as a toddler might be excited about her plan to ride a unicorn across a rainbow to an island made of chocolate. meanwhile, 30 million americans just lost their enhanced unemployment benefits because republicans cant bring themselves to give people the help they need, over 150,000 americans have died from covid-19, the administration cant come up with a strategy to address the pandemic or the economic crisis, and republicans seem increasingly resigned to the idea that trump will lose in november. in other words, what were seeing now is a kind of concentrated version of what has characterized the trump administration all along: a chaotic stew of fantasy and lies in which brief eruptions of candor from administration officials are quickly punished, but not before they highlight how ludicrous the prevailing line of spin is. and behind the spin is a reality of horror. but with each passing day, the spin is less capable of distracting from that reality. nobody likes me, the president recently moaned. he may be on to something.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,53094,131,CovidVaccine

vaccine is approved. none have been granted exclusive marketing rights, and one is the giant serum institute of india, the worlds largest supplier of vaccines. donors are currently spending tens of millions of dollars to start the manufacturing process at facilities in britain and the netherlands even before the vaccine is proven to work, said sandy douglas, 37, a doctor at oxford overseeing vaccine production. there is no alternative, he said. but the team has not yet reached an agreement with a north american manufacturer, in part because the major pharmaceutical companies there typically demand exclusive worldwide rights before investing in a potential medicine.","paywalls aren't cool. find another source. in the worldwide race for a vaccine to stop the coronavirus, the laboratory sprinting fastest is at oxford university. most other teams have had to start with small clinical trials of a few hundred participants to demonstrate safety. but scientists at the universitys jenner institute had a running start on a vaccine, having proved in previous trials that similar inoculations including one last year against an earlier coronavirus were harmless to humans. that has enabled them to leap ahead and schedule tests of their new coronavirus vaccine involving more than 6,000 people by the end of next month, hoping to show not only that it is safe, but also that it works. the oxford scientists now say that with an emergency approval from regulators, the first few million doses of their vaccine could be available by september at least several months ahead of any of the other announced efforts if it proves to be effective. now, they have received promising news suggesting that it might. scientists at the national institutes of healths rocky mountain laboratory in montana last month inoculated six rhesus macaque monkeys with single doses of the oxford vaccine. the animals were then exposed to heavy quantities of the virus that is causing the pandemic exposure that had consistently sickened other monkeys in the lab. but more than 28 days later all six were healthy, said vincent munster, the researcher who conducted the test. the rhesus macaque is pretty much the closest thing we have to humans, dr. munster said, noting that scientists were still analyzing the result. he said he expected to share it with other scientists next week and then submit it to a peer-reviewed journal. immunity in monkeys is no guarantee that a vaccine will provide the same degree of protection for humans. a chinese company that recently started a clinical trial with 144 participants, sinovac, has also said that its vaccine was effective in rhesus macaques. but with dozens of efforts now underway to find a vaccine, the monkey results are the latest indication that oxfords accelerated venture is emerging as a bellwether. it is a very, very fast clinical program, said emilio emini, a director of the vaccine program at the bill and melinda gates foundation, which is providing financial support to many competing efforts. which potential vaccine will emerge from the scramble as the most successful is impossible to know until clinical trial data becomes available. more than one vaccine would be needed in any case, dr. emini argued. some may work more effectively than others in groups like children or older people, or at different costs and dosages. having more than one variety of vaccine in production will also help avoid bottlenecks in manufacturing, he said.  but as the first to reach such a relatively large scale, the oxford trial, even if it fails, will provide lessons about the nature of the coronavirus and about the immune systems responses that can inform governments, donors, drug companies and other scientists hunting for a vaccine. this big u.k. study, dr. emini said, is actually going to translate to learning a lot about some of the others as well. all of the others will face the same challenges, including obtaining millions of dollars in funding, persuading regulators to approve human tests, demonstrating a vaccines safety and after all of that proving its effectiveness in protecting people from the coronavirus. paradoxically, the growing success of efforts to contain the spread of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, may present yet another hurdle. were the only people in the country who want the number of new infections to stay up for another few weeks, so we can test our vaccine, prof. adrian hill, the jenner institutes director and one of five researchers involved in the effort, said in an interview in a laboratory building emptied by britains monthlong lockdown. ethics rules, as a general principal, forbid seeking to infect human test participants with a serious disease. that means the only way to prove that a vaccine works is to inoculate people in a place where the virus spreading naturally around them. if social distancing measures or other factors continue to slow the rate of new infections in britain, he said, the trial might not be able to show that the vaccine makes a difference: participants who received a placebo might not be infected any more frequently than those who have been given the vaccine. the scientists would have to try again elsewhere, a dilemma that every other vaccine effort will face as well. the jenner institutes coronavirus efforts grew out of professor hills so-far unsuccessful pursuit of a vaccine against a different scourge, malaria. he developed a fascination with malaria and other tropical diseases as a medical student in dublin in the early 1980s, when he visited an uncle who was a priest working in a hospital during the civil war in what is now zimbabwe. i came back wondering, what do you see in these hospitals in england and ireland? professor hill said. they dont have any of these diseases. the major drug companies typically see little profit in epidemics that afflict mainly developing countries or run their course before a vaccine can hit the market. so after training in tropical medicine and a doctorate in molecular genetics, professor hill, 61, helped build oxfords institute into one of the largest academic centers dedicated to nonprofit vaccine research, with its own pilot manufacturing facility capable of producing a batch of up to 1,000 doses. the institutes effort against the coronavirus uses a technology that centers on altering the genetic code of a familiar virus. a classic vaccine uses a weakened version of a virus to trigger an immune response. but in the technology that the institute is using, a different virus is modified first to neutralize its effects and then to make it mimic a targeted virus in this case, the virus that causes covid-19. injected into the bloodstream, the harmless impostor can induce the immune system to fight and kill the targeted disease, providing protection. professor hill has worked with that technology for decades to try to tweak a respiratory virus found in chimpanzees in order to elicit a human immune response against malaria and other diseases. over the last 20 years, the institute has conducted more than 70 clinical trials of potential vaccines against the parasite that causes malaria. none have yet yielded a successful inoculation. in 2014, however, a vaccine based on the chimp virus that professor hill had tested was manufactured in a large enough scale to provide a million doses. that created a template for mass production of the coronavirus vaccine, should it prove effective. a longtime colleague, prof. sarah gilbert, 58, modified the same chimpanzee virus to make a vaccine against an earlier coronavirus, mers. after a clinical trial in britain demonstrated its safety, another test began in december in saudi arabia, where outbreaks of the deadly disease are still common. when she heard in january that chinese scientists had identified the genetic code of a mysterious virus in wuhan, she thought she might have a chance to prove the speed and versatility of their approach. we thought, well, should we have a go? she recalled. itll be a little lab project and well publish a paper. it did not stay a little lab project for long. as the pandemic exploded, grant money poured in. all other vaccines were soon put into the freezer so that the institutes laboratory could focus full-time on covid-19. then the lockdown forced everyone not working on covid-19 to stay home altogether. the whole world doesnt usually stand up and say, how can we help? do you want some money? professor hill said. vaccines are good for pandemics, he added, and pandemics are good for vaccines. other scientists involved in the project are working with a half dozen drug manufacturing companies across europe and asia to prepare to churn out billions of doses as quickly as possible if the vaccine is approved. none have been granted exclusive marketing rights, and one is the giant serum institute of india, the worlds largest supplier of vaccines. donors are currently spending tens of millions of dollars to start the manufacturing process at facilities in britain and the netherlands even before the vaccine is proven to work, said sandy douglas, 37, a doctor at oxford overseeing vaccine production. there is no alternative, he said. but the team has not yet reached an agreement with a north american manufacturer, in part because the major pharmaceutical companies there typically demand exclusive worldwide rights before investing in a potential medicine. i personally dont believe that in a time of pandemic there should be exclusive licenses, professor hill said. so we are asking a lot of them. nobody is going to make a lot of money off this. the jenner institutes vaccine effort is not the only one showing promise. two american companies, moderna and inovio, have started small clinical trials with technologies involving modified or otherwise manipulated genetic material. they are seeking both to demonstrate their safety and to learn more about dosing and other variables. neither technology has ever produced a licensed drug or been manufactured at scale.

There are more than one example of Republicans meeting with Dems during Obama's terms, agreeing on a bill, and then still voting it down because making the Dems look bad was top priority. Also, responding to Biden's 2.1 trillion bill (who again won with a HUGE mandate in my opinion, in both popular vote, electoral votes, and Georgia sending two den senators after knowing Biden won and that his plan would need more dems) with a quarter of that amount isn't really something I think the minority party should be allowed to do. I mean, yes they can, but that doesn't seem like a honest attempt at compromise. Again, we'll see, but they already negotiated with Dems about the Jan 6th commission and then filibustered it anyways. You haven't commented on that yet, and I'm curious what you think about that. 
Did pelosi and Schumer ever come out in 2016 and say ""Our top priority for the next 4 years is making Trump a one term president"" because unless I missed that, they don't seem comparable. They might have said they will oppose Trump's policies and try and stop them, but with republicans winning the trifecta in 2016 I would have been fine with letting them govern since that is what the American people wanted at the time. 
Republicans own the majority of state legislatures because they have states with a smaller population than my California highschool (hyperbole, but you get the point. Also edit to say I'm not a student, I'm a teacher. Math/physics). Dems do too with some small new England states, but the vast majority of states that are small population States are Republican safe States. Again, this is why I'm upset with the senate being doubly biased towards the minority. I live in LA county, a population of about 10mil. Wyoming, with a population of 700k or so, has more representation with less than a 10th of the people. And the fact that most small rural states are Republican already gives the minority a huge boost in politics. I don't think they also need the filibuster. 
To conclude, I agree we need to protect the minority, but not at the expense of the majority. Most Americans support Biden's infrastructure bill. Most Americans support the ""for the people act"" (the voting rights bill) and there was even leaked audio of a republican meeting where they admitted most Republican voters like that bill when you just explain it unbiased. Most Americans supported Biden's COVID response. Most Americans wanted a Jan 6th investigation. But because a minority of Americans are overrepresented in the Senate, and Congress needs a super majority to get anything done because of the filibuster, the majority can kick rocks. I don't think that's fair and will be the downfall of our democracy since Republicans stopped operating in good faith. You have republicans who were caught on camera helping block doors to stop the mob from getting in on Jan 6th coming out today and saying ""Oh it was just a tour group that got a bit routy."" They don't care anymore, and if the filibuster continues to exist in it's current form (I'd be willing to try the talking filibuster as a compromise, but won't hold my breath on that fixing the issues I see), they will just do a repeat of the Obama years. Block everything, even their own legislation (yes they did this during Obama's terms), because most Americans will blame the president and the party they come from. 
We might just have a fundamental difference on our beliefs. To me, if a single party controls both houses of Congress and the presidency, they should be allowed to do basically all of their [constitutional] legislation. That is exactly in line with what the founding fathers wanted since that's how they wrote the Constitution. If the American people don't like it, they will vote somebody else in next time. That cannot be worse than a government that does nothing while 500k Americans die from COVID or sits back and watches as our infrastructure completely crumbles. I'll read your response to this, but I don't think I'll debate anymore since the difference seems to be a core difference in how we think the country should run.",1,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,h0li0fo,28,CMV

&gt;It can only if a) you have no fucking clue how vaccines work b) dont understand what emergency authorization is. 
One of my degrees is biology related, and both are in the sciences; but please, as I can be wrong, explain to me as you are so confident. 
&gt;You have. Either get vaccinated or you wont be allowed to study there. Just like paying for it, you are using a privilage of studying there. If they set up a set of rules you have to follow in order to study there, you will follow them. As someone with couple degrees you surely know this very basic truth. 
What constitutes an 'establishment' isn't very unclear. An establishment can be dominated by one person. There are even entire governments dominated by one person. It is strange that if a person asks you something it is coercion, but if an organizations asks (which may be led by one person) then it is fine. Or are you saying that what matters is not the fact that they are giving you a choice between your body and career, but the details of that question. It really is unclear where one would draw the line because it is hard to parse out the details (of course, this isn't very hard from my three examples). It is clear you are highly biased in favor of vaccines (I am not saying anyone shouldn't take it!).

291,"You'd think this would have been noticed by some other governments by now, but she claimed ""only people in alternative health fields seem to know about this.""","Thank you for this awesome post. I strongly agree with the premise and scope of the problem, but I don't think citing studies necessarily makes anyone's opinion better. Most people are just bad consumers of information. This goes hand in hand with appeals to authority, but is not necessarily the same. 
Example: recently my mom showed me a text from a friend who is an ""alternative medicine practitioner"" about COVID-19. I gave it a fair read, despite obvious red flags. It contained some claims which were somewhat based on, or at least extrapolated from real medical research (which I had to find myself, as she didn't cite anything). Turns out [Elderberry may be effective against coronaviruses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170219304198). OK, I wouldn't go chugging the stuff, but good enough for me to give it a try, I thought. 
However, this text had a line that made me lol pretty hard, which said something like: ""Important: The Panamanian government used Elderberry as its only treatment for its citizens during the 1995 H1N1 outbreak and not a single death was recorded."" Really? You'd think this would have been noticed by some other governments by now, but she claimed ""only people in alternative health fields seem to know about this."" Amazing. 
This was so rich, I had to dig in further - it is so specific that I figured it must have been generated by some game of internet-telephone, where blog posts and chain emails result in language morphing and the meaning changing completely. I find this stuff fascinating. With one quick search I found that [someone had already done the work for me](https://badsciencedebunked.com/2015/10/21/naturally-nicoles-elderberry-flu-treatment-debunked-part-1/). It's quite a hilarious read (*B. panama* is a virus strain) but the highlight is that some lady appears to have actually cited some studies, but is an idiot and a fraud with a microphone. I'm still debating whether to share this with the person who sent it to my mom. I doubt it's going to make a difference, as she'll probably get mad and blame it on the pharma industry. 
The irony is that her belief in ""alternative health"" seems to be influenced by reading actual health studies (badly). Obviously this is a result of sheer stupidity all around, but my point is that citing research does no good, in fact it can do a lot of bad, unless the person citing it has the smarts and training to interpret and discuss it with others. It can be like giving matches to children. Same goes for philosophy, I might add! 
The question is not whether people should read more studies, but what authorities can they trust to relay information to them?

Has he really? What is your evidence of that claim? Yes, the unemployment rate continued to decrease in his first three years, but it had been[ steadily decreasing since 2010.](https://www.thebalance.com/unemployment-rate-by-year-3305506) And even so, I don't think he took any specific action to bring that about. He inherited a healthy economy which was created by his predecessor in the wake of the financial crisis. His early successes seem to me to be simply a continuation of the trend that began under Obama. What has his economic policy been that has created this effect? The only tangible bit of policy that I can think of is his tax cut, which not everyone agrees on. I guess there's also the NAFTA renegotiation, but the changes to the agreement are incredibly minor and have not likely had much of an impact on the job market. * At best* he has shifted the focus slightly to manufacturing jobs. Seems to me that you're trying to give him credit for not doing much of anything. Which, in fairness I suppose he could have destroyed the economy, but I don't think he deserves a medal for not doing that. 
&gt; He is doing more good than harm
I suppose this is subjective, but I have a hard time seeing how. He has absolutely bungled the response to COVID and he and his party are the major reason why the [outbreak in the US continues to worsen while it is largely slowing down in Europe and much of the rest of the developed world.](https://www.gzeromedia.com/the-graphic-truth-two-different-pandemics-eu-vs-us-coronavirus-cases-spike-28-june) And it's only getting worse. He has finally been seen wearing a mask,[ but for months he called the virus a hoax](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-calls-coronavirus-democrats-new-hoax-n1145721), claimed it would[ go away on its own

His foreign policy has been largely disastrous from my point of view. [ He has alienated the majority of our allies](https://thehill.com/policy/international/458455-here-are-the-us-allies-that-have-been-in-trumps-crosshairs) and he has removed the US from a position of international leadership by [withdrawing from numerous international agreements and organizations](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/01/politics/nuclear-treaty-trump/index.html). By the way, the article that I linked there is over a year old and doesn't include [Trump's withdrawal from the WHO in the middle of a global pandemic](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/07/politics/us-withdrawing-world-health-organization/index.html). The organizations that we have not formally left have been seriously undermined by his threats. He also seems to take pleasure in antagonizing Iran. He not only pulled out of the deal to keep them from acquiring nuclear weapons, he also unilaterally decided to assassinate one of their top generals. He has made huge claims about North Korea and the Israel-Palestine conflict, [but his actions with North Korea were largely for show and no actual progress was made] (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-s-kim-backs-away-trump-relationship-two-years-n1230371) and his administration has [claimed it supports a ""realistic two-state solution"" with regard to Israel and Palestine, but his actions have made that near impossible. ]( https://www.mei.edu/blog/trumps-peace-plan-aims-bury-two-state-solution) By moving the embassy to Jerusalem and essentially approving illegal Israeli settlements, that possibility seems more remote than ever.

That only barely scratches the surface, but I'd be here forever if I had to list all of the allegedly corrupt and incompetent officials. You can look it up if you want to see more. Obviously this is a mix of current and former officials, but the trend is troubling. And the turnover in itself seems to be problematic. Why are so many people leaving or getting fired? And its worth noting that several of his former officials (such as John Bolton and Jim Mattis, among others) have spoken out about how dangerous they think the President is. And that's just the people that he actually has appointed. [ Several other key positions remain unfulfilled because he just won't nominate anyone](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/help-wanted-trump-administration-riddled-vacancies-n983036). Although that's probably better than having the unqualified and corrupt filling those positions
Also, I would be remiss if I did not mention the fact that Trump has:
- [been recklessly deregulating](https://www.sdstandardnow.com/home/the-dark-side-of-deregulation-president-trumps-reckless-perilous-war-on-science-and-restraint) (that article deals largely with environmental regulations, but the administration has been deregulating almost every area with seemingly no regard for consequences), 
- has been accused of numerous crimes, [including obstruction of justice, collusion with a foreign power, violations of the emoluments clause, and violations of various other ethical rules and norms, among many others.](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-complete-listing-so-far-atrocities-1-796#update) 
- [has lied tens of thousands of times about every topic under the sun](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidmarkowitz/2020/05/05/trump-is-lying-more-than-ever-just-look-at-the-data/#3c6ed20b1e17). Mind you, lying is not exactly out of the ordinary for politicians, but the frequency with which lies about everything from the most mundane to most important issues is alarming. Many of them are not even debatable. As in, he has simply outright misstated easily verifiable facts. 
- has undermined democratic values at nearly every turn by attacking the media and those he doesn't like, even when they're simply stating basic facts or asking questions. He has made every attempt to act like a strongman, and this Senate has essentially allowed it. 
Obviously, some of these things are subjective. If you're anti-institutionalist, anti-Iran, anti-Palestinian, anti-trade, and anti-regulation, then I can see why you may think Trump has done some good. But even then, I have to believe that those who support those policies see the danger in the way he's going about it. It's fine for example to like deregulation, but surely it's better for everyone if he does it in a responsible manner. 
Other things are less subjective I think. If you're ok with the President obstructing justice and outright lying, then you don't support basic American values. And I understand that people believe there is some debate as to the extent to which he engaged in these activities and his culpability, but his supporters refuse to even consider the evidence. 
In light of all this, I have a hard time seeing how the good outweighs the bad, even if you support some of his policies. Since I definitely don't support his policies, I struggle to find *any* good that has come of this administration. From allegations of corruption, treason, and obstruction of justice to his total lack of leadership, attacks on democratic principles, and his lack of any truly productive legislation or action, the list just goes on. Mind you, what's listed above are just the highlights that came to mind immediately. I could talk about many other actions which I think most would perceive as negative about from his attempts to abridge the rights of Americans to other rule of law violations, but I simply don't have the time to get to all of them.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,fya8jjx,393,CMV

Policing isn't an all or nothing situation, but those who obey the law tend to like police to help in their community. I live in a city that has 4 times the national average for violent crime.

&gt;Hitler is one the most purely evil humans to ever be in the earth. 
I think it's important to note that within Western culture, Hitler is sort of seen as the epitome of evil for two significant reasons: his atrocities were committed in relatively recent history, and his victims were Westerners. People like Vlad Tepes, Genghis Khan, Pol Pot, and Leopold II were argubly worse people, but they either lived too long ago to be accessible examples, or the descendants of their victims don't make up a signficant portion of the Western world. Because of this, I don't think it's fair to say that such a comparison is *lazy,* when it might be more accurate to say that Hitler is just the most *accessible/convenient* example of a fascist dictator who did terrible things. Comparisons to Hitler aren't to establish Trump is equivalently evil, but that the way Trump interacts with the world and rules is *appropriately similar* to how fascism can take hold in a liberal democracy like the United State or the Weimar Republic. 
Now, you're entirely correct that there are key differences in how Hitler specifically became Führer, and how Trump has behaved as President. However, I want to bring up [Umberto Eco's 14 features of Ur-Fascism/Eternal Fascism.](https://web.archive.org/web/20170131155837/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/)
&gt;The cult of tradition. “ One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.” 
Donald Trump's campaign slogan was ""Make America Great Again."" His entire political career is based on the idea of returning to point at which the country was better than it is today. 
&gt;The rejection of modernism. “ The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.” 
Trump rejects modern scientific thinking in many ways, including denial of climate change, rejection of COVID safety measures, and supporting the link between vaccinations and autism. 
&gt;The cult of action for action’s sake. “ Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.” 
I think that the recent demonstration at the U.S. Capitol building speaks for itself on this. 
&gt; Disagreement is treason. “ The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.” 
Again, Trump's rhetoric surrounding his recent loss, including the recent attack on the Capitol is a shining example of this. Republicans who don't blindly fall in line are called RINOs, and any of his staff that go against him are called ""traitors"" and fired. 
&gt; Fear of difference. “ The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.” 
Trump is openly xenophobic. He supported a self-labeled ""Muslim ban"" that restricted travel from many Arabic countries, his first campagin promise was to build a wall that would keep out Mexicans, and he has been notably anti-China as President, especially following the pandemic. 
&gt;Appeal to social frustration. “ One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.” 
This one seems pretty self-explanatory but I'm willing to go into more detail upon request. 
&gt; The obsession with a plot. “ The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.” 
Trump pushes conspiracy theories from people like Alex Jones. 
&gt;The humiliation by the wealth and force of their enemies. “ By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.” 
[The 100-plus times Donald Trump assured us that America is a laughingstock](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/27/the-100-plus-times-donald-trump-has-assured-us-the-united-states-is-a-laughingstock/)
&gt; Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “ For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.” 
I personally think that his rhetoric exemplifies this but I would struggle to give concrete examples so let's say this one doesn't count. 
&gt; Contempt for the weak. “ Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.” 
""He's not a hero. He's a hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured."" 
&gt; Everybody is educated to become a hero. “ In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.” 
Ehh I don't really have anything for this one. 
&gt; Machismo and weaponry. “ Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.” 
I'll refer to his ""grab 'em by the pussy"" tape because I don't care to bring up his entire history of sexist/sexual comments. I'll also bring up his ban on transgender troops from the military. 
&gt; Selective populism. “ There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.” 
The way Trump (used to) use Twitter exemplifies this imo. 
&gt; Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “ All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.” 
Trump's style of speaking is very simple and very distinctive. You can immediately tell when you're reading anything he's written. 
Does all of this make Trump Hitler? No. But is the comparison appropriate as a warning agaisnt the rise of fascist ideas? I think so.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,gisapjd,109,CMV

That's the info I have and that's also what I have read in other sources so far. I am not aware of any official plan to use half doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine. If you mean the timing of the vaccine then what I think that was supported by evidence shown in the trial and you will need sources to convince me otherwise.

This doesn't even support the claim you were trying to make. Yes it's a valid criticism, one that I wasn't aware of. But it isn't a valid criticism for the half dose or the Astra Zeneca vaccine itself, which is what your original claim was.

Not relevant to the original argument that we should be sceptical about Astra Zeeca specifically but valid criticism.

have you heard of science communication? probably the biggest problem is shitty reporting that claims something cures cancer when research shows it simply kills it in vitro. helping people not well versed in the field understand is a major part of being an actual scientist. instead you leapt to the conclusion that i only understand google results.  you know that now that we are looking for it were finding dozens of new corona viruses in bats? heres just one of many sources doing just that. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230802 . it takes more time to catch and swab the bats than it does to determine it is a novel coronavirus through even conventional pcr. when people were getting pneumonia and testing negative for all known human coronaviruses but showing the high sequence homology that it has to sars (which does not require the new viruss sequence anyway, just a run through your search function then we knew we had a new coronavirus similar to one which kicked our asses for a few rounds 10 years ago.  high throughput and other next gen sequencing techniques means that it doesnt take long to figure out a novel viruss genome if we have a member of its family with pretty high similarity so we can line up the individual pieces using bioinformatics if the virus isnt short enough to sequence it in a single sequence. we arent using only sanger sequencing techniques or single locus pcr just like we arent wholly reliant on edman degradation for proteome sequences anymore. im not sure what part of the process of identifying the virus you thought was so fast?  when i want a protein sequenced (and you can be sure they rapidly digested and started putting together the proteome sequences of covid-19s proteins at the same time that they were sequencing its genome... probably using sars as a comparison when it came to putting the proteome sequences back together... i would have) i go to maldi-tof ms... which is usually enough to figure it out if its anything weve seen before, and send it out to a lab with ms/ms if it turns out to be totally new. this is if we cant determine it easier by just looking at the transcriptome if we have a good one for that species that has a sequence with a perfect match for our maldi-tof mass. we couldnt use the transcriptome like that until recently. now we can get venom transcriptomes from shed skin.  the tests we are currently using for covid-19 are slow compared to what we could and will be doing when weve done the part that does take a lot of time. were using covid-19 specific primers and pcr for a lot of testing. we literally just toss in the primers and see if we get amplification from a patients sample, too bad theyve got a 30% false negative rate so theyre got to be repeated a few times to be sure. this kind of test wouldnt even require the whole viral sequence.  what we want and dont have a very reliable test yet is a reliable elisa on a lateral flow immunoassay test. or another antibody based test. we need to mass produce and isolate/purify and tag or affix antibodies that bind only to covid-19 proteins as an antigen, or we need to affix covid 19 antigens to a substrate so that human blood can be run on the platform to determine if antibodies to those covid-19 antigens are present through some kind of detectable (fluorescent or luminescent or just visible) secondary antibody tagging. an example of an elisa for multiple viruses or pathogens looks something like this: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pscgozerxhg (a product which i did r&d on prior to starting my phd program). these kinds of tests are the ones that take a lot of time to get right. unspecific binding is a big problem. you need just the right antibodies or youre going to tag people have or have had similar coronaviruses which have very similar surface proteins... and therefore our body produces very similar antibodies to... so similar their could be binding of antibodies produced for one strain that bind to the other (literally how we used cowpox as a smallpox vaccine).  im asking out of curiosity, id still love to have an actual discussion about what we did with covid-19 scientifically that was so fast you didnt think it was possible with our current technology? i was personally really impressed with how quickly they got the tertiary and quaternary structure of certain proteins and complexes. ive never heard of x-ray crystallography or other method of determining 3d structure being performed so quickly as it has on some of the covid-19 proteins (specifically the ace2 binding site/spike). i think this was one of the papers that impressed me most in terms of how fast it came out (not peer reviewed) but it was available by the end of february. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.956235v1.full what about you?",1,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1,88200,152,CovidVaccine

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act
It's more akin to an independent government agency than a government or a strictly private entity, but we don't call it that so it doesn't get politicized. 
The reason the US dollar is the world's reserve currency is because the US can back up its claims with actual wealth, power, and value.  The Federal Reserve creating money through citizens instead of banks doesn't change that calculus.  You keep insinuating that I want the Fed to print infinite money for US citizens and it's disingenuous.  
I really don't care whether the Fed would still technically be a central bank in your view if it created money through citizens instead of banks.  
I think your fears of hyperinflation and loss of global trust in the dollar are hyperbolic.  Given that I haven't advocated for a higher inflation rate than the 2% target the Fed sets currently, your concerns about somehow stealing from non-US actors who use the dollar is also misguided. 
What technological progress has to do with the Fed is that our institutions, understanding, and way of life should evolve along with technology.  Imagine if after the development of agriculture, people kept hunting and gathering because that' s what they had always done.  Civilization would never have gotten off the ground. 
Likewise, it's nonsensical for people's way of life and understanding to not evolve as technology does in the 21st century, and maybe that should include people's relationship to and the role of a central bank.  
Instead of most people working most of their lives for basics like healthcare, housing, and education/jobs, our way of life should be geared toward eradicating poverty altogether and achieving higher levels of development.  
That may mean changing people's relationship with money and wealth to some extent.  
Right now we are as much of an oligarchy as we are a democracy, with the super wealthy capturing most of the economic and technological progress since the 1980's, and health and wealth outcomes for most people getting worse:
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/10/opinion/coronavirus-us-economy-inequality.html
If technological progress isn't making people's lives better, that calls for some degree of institutional change, whether that's giving the central bank different kinds of tools or some other changes. 
But decentralized money creation via the Fed is ultimately no more radical than the UBI that's being proposed by all kinds of economists and political figures in the face of technological progress, so I don't think the sky would fall down if it eventually came to pass.

The worst presidents are those who either ignored their crisis or actively made it worse. Andrew Johnson sabotaged reconstruction post-Civil War. Buchanan ignored the incoming Civil War out of fear. These two are consistently ranked the worst two presidents. 
Trump’s crisis was COVID, and not only did he ignore the problem, he actively sabotaged it. He didn’t come up with a federal plan. Made states fight for his favor to receive life saving supplies. Promoted conspiracy theories and denounced his own advisors publicly. 
This had consequences, 500K died by the time Biden came into office. I’ve heard that over 200k of those deaths could have been prevented.

I've never even seen an obese person in the clinic.","&gt;But obesity is both the number one comorbidity in COVID-related deaths and the number one cause of preventable death in the United States. 
Obesity isn't a comorbidity it's the secondary afflictions, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, etc.. that are. But this could be present in non-obese patients also. 
&gt;Obesity and COVID have a crucial difference: obesity isn’t contagious. 
Exactly, don't know what you were trying to prove but it actually works against your argument. 
&gt;people filling up hospital beds due to preventable illnesses is. And the fact of the matter is, obesity is a huge burden on the healthcare system—and it’s also a huge factor in COVID hospitalizations. 
Wrong, outside of the current situation obese patients have never been the majority of patients in ICU, since Covid got rolling Covid patients have been for the last year with about a two-three month dip then resurgence. Never have there been so many obese patients hospitalized that they've had to turn patients away because they were over filled with fat dying people. Obesity doesn't hospitalize you till it's become a dire situation and that takes years of neglect. Covid takes days to weeks. Obesity doesn't keep patients in beds for weeks or even months at a time using up resources at a high rate. ICU patients suffering from Covid can use 4 tanks of oxygen, some more a day. Not to mention the constant other medications that they have to give. You have to realize obesity doesn't put a strain on our healthcare system on any given day it's the financial cost over years. Covid patients can rack up the same bill as a obese person in one month that normally would take years or even a lifetime for a obese person. Obese patients don't need constant monitoring, you take care of what's afflicting them at the moment send them home and let the PCP/Specialist handle it. Long haul Covid will probably cost more than obese patients in the long run for all we know. My friend just posted a update on FB yesterday that he was back in the hospital for the 6th time since catching Covid a year ago. He now has reduced lung capacity, and out of those 6 times he has been admitted three have been for the same thing, DVT he never had it before now he's had it three times and almost died when one clot made it to his lungs. 
&gt;And obesity is 100% curable; for free. If hospitals started refusing to treat obese patients, people who need treatment for causes out of their control would unequivocally receive a higher quality of care. 
This is untrue. They're genetic dispositions for obesity. I know several people who eat less calories a day than me but are overweight. There are people with thyroid conditions that cause them to gain massive amounts of weight and are mainly undiagnosed because doctors don't test for it unless they suspect it. I had a female friend who was heavy set the doctors keep telling her to stop eating, exercise more, blah blah. Never listened to her when she told them she was on a low calorie diet they assumed she was lying. Fast forward 6 years later a woman doctor listened to her and tested her thyroid and found out her problem. You probably also never heard of a food desert. In almost every major city their are food deserts somewhere and guess what ? That's where you find huge pockets of obese people. That's not thier fault as they simply don't have access to adequate nutritional food sources. Where I live now I have four supermarkets in a 1 mile radius and three farmer markets available through the week.

At the end of the day an obese person doesn't negatively impact the people around them just being present. Obese people are visually obese and if your disgusted by them you can see them a mile away and avoid them.

1. For 5 years, every time my wife went to the gyno, they tried to push a new drug on her. Since there were no long-term clinical trials, she said no. The OB-GYN gave her a hard time, but she held her ground. Sure enough, after 5 years, it was discovered people who had taken the drug were dealing with illnesses and severe side effects. Class action lawsuits started. My wife and I vowed after that we would NEVER take a drug/vaccine that hasn't had long-term clinical trials (5 years or more).
2. COVID is a very close relative of rhinovirus, the same type of virus that causes the common cold. We've never produced a vaccine for the common cold (and why should we? it constantly mutates so a vaccine would be useless within a year). Does anyone else find it slightly suspicious that we've never been able to find a cure for the common cold (or any autoimmune disorder) despite decades of work, and then we suddenly and conveniently produce a vaccine for coronavirus in just 8 months?
3. When I turned 18, my parents said 'you're old enough to decide for yourself now if you want to get a flu shot each year.' 16 years have passed since then. Only once in that stretch have I gotten the flu, and guess what? It was coincidentally the only year in that stretch where I took the flu shot. Made me wonder...
4. I'm 34 years old, I'm in OUTSTANDING physical shape (probably top 5% of my age bracket in terms of physical fitness and overall health), and I have no pre-existing conditions. For people like me, COVID has a 99.998% survival rate. That rate doesn't justify taking a potentially risky vaccine that hasn't had long-term clinical trials, no matter what the ""experts"" claim. They don't know for sure. It's that simple. They don't know for sure what the long-term effects will be.

I never said the vaccine is useless, only that the data so far won't see it approved.","> Different countries and exposures doesn't matter

Why, of course it does. Different genetic makeup, hence you expect a difference efficacy. Different exposure, e.g. nurses being exposed to very high viral loads, of course you expect different result, different age groups, different placebos, no placebos at all in some cases. Even more worrying, that some subgroups seem to have been discarded entirely. Now sure, you could average over all of that. But that's just not how phase 3 trials are supposed to be conducted, and for good reasons.

> There isn't huge variation in doses. Just an error with 1 group which can likely be taken out

That's unfortunately not true. From the Wired article:

>> The doses are measured by the number of altered viral particles they contain, and the developers decided that the standard dose would be 5 x 10^10 viral particles. But for many of those arms in the UK trial—as well as everyone who got the vaccine in the Brazilian trial—**publicly available trial information shows that the standard dose could be between 3.5 and 6.5 × 10^10 viral particles**. The lower end of that range isn’t far off from a half-dose.

> Do you really think the best scientists in the world

I'm one myself, so yeah I think it's definitely possible that they made mistakes. You have to see this in the proper context, this was the first vaccine globally (except perhaps Chinese versions) that went into a phase 3 trial, and the whole thing was developed and approved for test phases much, much faster than would normally be the case. It's easily possible that corners were cut where necessary, and that the regulator approved incomplete or shaky test protocols out of a necessity to develop this fast. Also, the fact that phase 3 was started just before (or already during) the March UK lockdown presented a problem that you don't normally encounter, that the exposure of your control groups was too little to allow for proper statistics. That's why they restarted in Brazil, and it was always going to be difficult to use those results as one combined study.

> If they don't then they will continue the trials until they do

Absolutely. That's why they started an entirely fresh phase-3 trial in the US. But that wasn't started until late August and then held up by that case of a severe side effect in one of the UK groups. so it's well behind Pfizer and Moderna at this stage.

> is horseshit as you haven't even seen the data.

Everything we know about the data, and how the test was conducted, points in that direction. The Wired article contains information about the trials that is in the public domain, beyond what's in the press release. Even just the mere fact that they *have* to combine two tests in two different countries, conducted under different conditions, will likely prevent this from being approved anywhere. And AstraZeneca makes no secret that this was always the plan.

> So much lack of education in everything you wrote tbh.

It has been approved in the *UK*, but neither the European Union nor any other European country has approved it.  Also, India likely approved it because the UK did.

Second, the US isn't ""waiting until April,"" but some people have stated that's when it might be approved.  The simple fact is that it's not even possible to approve at this point because Astrazeneca hasn't even applied for approval in the U.S. (or EU for that matter).  

They probably haven't applied because they know there's a good chance they'll get rejected without U.S. data, especially when the data from other countries suffers from so many problems (many mistakes, low sample size, etc.).  These problems will  *hopefully* be resolved when the next month or two with the conclusion of Astrazeneca's trials in the U.S.  Because of mistakes, the sample size for any particular regimen of administering the vaccine is anywhere from 1/15 to 1/5 the size of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, depending upon which regimen you look at.  (Pfizer and Moderna tested just one regimen, whereas Astrazeneca ""tested"" about 5 across 12k people in the trials that have been released, because of differences in trials in the UK and Brazil, in addition to the many mistakes that were made during the trials (including incorrect dosages and incorrect timing of vaccine administration).)

The truth is, the UK is really going past the science in their approval.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but that's a fact.  They have advised that doses for both Astrazeneca and Pfizer should be given 12 weeks apart, and that individuals who receive one particular vaccine first can receive the other vaccine second.  Necessary?  Will it save lives? Probably.  But not grounded in trials that actually tested this, particularly for Pfizer.  And this recommendation has been done against Pfizer's own admonishment that there is no data to support this regimen actually working for their vaccine.  The UK is engaging in what one might call ""armchair"" science.  Normally, we have a hypothesis and test it.  They have a hypothesis, and are determining conditions are so dire that they must act on it without testing it first, because based on our experience with other vaccines, this will *probably* be good.

There's also the fact that the U.S. simply doesn't need more vaccine at this moment.  Right now, the hold up isn't the number of vaccines, it's administration of vaccines.

525,"We have to run the paperwork through the computer system. Getting vaccines ready can take time, time away from us being able to do our actual job.","As a pharmacist working for one of the chains above I'd like to have a PSA.

Our industry is already short staffed in many chains and in many areas throughout the country. Depending on where we work we may have to fill hundreds of prescriptions, while giving COVID shots and other immunizations to people. 

Giving shots is no small task. We have to screen for safety and appropriateness. We have to run the paperwork through the computer system. Getting vaccines ready can take time, time away from us being able to do our actual job. I'd say each shot takes at least 10-15 minutes unless you have a clinic set up.

We don't have enough time in the day to give 40 shots and fill every prescription.

Most of us don't get to take breaks or even have a lunch, working 8-12 hr shifts. The COVID shots will have to be billed by the end of the day so we will likely be doing a lot of overtime, potentially not for pay.

So my point is, be nice to your pharmacy. We are about to get hit hard, and I don't believe we will be well reimbursed for all of this effort.

550,"In the Pfizer vaccine it seems no significant medical intervention was required for any of the 20,000 in the vaccine arm. I will need to read up on the Moderna results as at this time my government has a confirmed order with Pfizer but not Moderna and I will likely be one of the initial priority group.","I've worked giving vaccines and from this early talk it certainly sound like there will need to be a greater emphasis placed on potential effects and it will need to be an important point to emphasize with the public. It will definitely be crucial to communicate honestly in order to gain more widespread acceptance. 

The ""deal with it"" attitude comes from frustration with general vaccine skepticism. Common childhood vaccines are very safe and significant side-effects very rare and the overall benefit to society is so very clear. No matter how much research and communication we put out there is still a significant number of people who push back with disinformation. The issue being they work so well that the diseases they prevent are so uncommon now I can see the concern on an individual level if there is an apparent significant risk at all, most people do not possess the skills to property evaluate the information for themselves. 

As these articles rightly discuss (this is the third I've seen this week before the study has even been published) it will likely be a different conversation as the disease is so common but immune reactions much more pronounced. Concern and skepticism in this case is very reasonable but the reasons for the general public's nervousness is mostly down to anti-vax false and misleading information that has been pushed for years. 

I would speculate you are right that it is a downside of a quick development cycle in that they have titrated the dose for maximum efficacy with the trade-off being a more noticeable immune reaction. In the Pfizer vaccine it seems no significant medical intervention was required for any of the 20,000 in the vaccine arm.

The fact of the matter is that the Astra Zeneca vaccine is *probably* safe and *probably* effective.

Vaccine safety is rightly taken extremely seriously, at least in the US, and *probably* isn’t a word you should use when discussing safety. Assuming the American trial of the AZ vaccine goes well they might get EUA equivalent approval in the UK in a few months.
